## What makes a good simulator?
- Sniper, gem5, ChampSim
- Complexity in building & coupling each components

> The dynamic instruction count is the actual number of instructions executed by the CPU for a specific program execution, whereas the static instruction count is the number of instruction the program has.
We usually use dynamic instruction count as if for example you have a loop in your program then some instructions get executed more than once. Also, in the presence of branches, some instructions may not be executed at all.
# ## Instruction Types
- ***Instruction level parallelism***
### Branch Predictors
### Event Queue (model)
### Memory Systems

## ISCA 2024 Best Paper: Constable
### On inter-occurance distance (reuse interval)
- Bimodal behavior (< 50 && > 250)
