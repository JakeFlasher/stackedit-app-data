## What makes a good simulator?
- Sniper, gem5, ChampSim
- Complexity in building & coupling each components

> The dynamic instruction count is the actual number of instructions executed by the CPU for a specific program execution, whereas the static instruction count is the number of instruction the program has.
We usually use dynamic instruction count as if for example you have a loop in your program then some instructions get executed more than once. Also, in the presence of branches, some instructions may not be executed at all.

> After reordering of the trimmed/residual trace (csv), have corrected the plotting issues in libcachesim, while the problem of whether this out-of-order in trace processing is encountered is not solved. This may be the key to restoring the results on residual trace in ChampSim.
## Cache Behavior
- Cache miss ratio, Accessing patterns (phase)
>HRD as an arch independent metric for generating synthetic traces.
## Instruction Types
## Branch Predictors
## Event Queue (model)
## Memory Systems
