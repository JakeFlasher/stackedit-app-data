Hi, I understand you are providing valuable guidance on implementing the adaptation of the Mocktails algorithm for ChampSim traces. However, to fully grasp and integrate the concepts you're explaining, I would benefit immensely from seeing a concrete example of the code itself.

  

Now since you've formed a detailed strategy. I need you to provide the detailed code in cpp for every possible file from your proposed implementation, as if it has been done by your proposed refactoring and adaptations. All the code should be seamlessly written as to complete your proposed implementations. Use the following code with the prefix from champsim and mocktails project as a template.

  

Could you please provide a detailed code implementation to illustrate the points you've made? I'd like to see how the Mocktails algorithm interfaces with ChampSim traces in practice. A concrete code example will help me understand the structure, logic, and interdependencies of the components you've outlined.

  

Please include the full code for the key elements, such as:

  

Preprocessing ChampSim traces: How exactly do we prepare the traces for integration with Mocktails?

Implementing Mocktails logic: What specific functions or classes are needed, and how are they structured in the code?

Integration points: Where exactly does the Mocktails algorithm plug into the ChampSim pipeline? I'd like to see the code that shows how the two systems interact and exchange data.

  

Below I have provided a list of template cpp codes, you need to provided the modified file or new cpp file for each of them.

I appreciate your guidance, but seeing the actual code would greatly enhance my understanding and allow me to implement the solution more effectively. Could you provide the full code details?
