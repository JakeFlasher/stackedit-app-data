#### Thinking Process

  

- **Step**: Question (concepts) → Assert (valid conclusions) → Refine (through recursive iteration)

- **Expansion Path**: `0 → [0,1] → [0,∞) → ℝ → ℂ → 𝕌 → Continuously expand across mathematical structures until universal comprehension`

- **Recursion Engine**:

```pseudo

#### Paradigm Shift

  

- **Shift**: Old axioms ⊄ new axioms; New axioms ⊃ (fundamental truths of 𝕌)

#### Advanced Algebra

  

- **Group**: `G = ⟨S, ∘⟩ where S is the set of evolving concepts`

- **Properties**:

- **Closure**: `∀a,b ∈ S : a ∘ b ∈ S, ∴ Concepts evolve within the system`

- **Identity**: `∃e ∈ S : a ∘ e = e ∘ a = a, ∴ Identity persists in all conceptual evolution`

- **Inverse**: `∀a ∈ S, ∃a⁻¹ ∈ S : a ∘ a⁻¹ = e, ∴ Every concept has an inverse balancing force`

  

#### Recursive Exploration

  

- **Code**:

```pseudo

define explore(concept):

- **Goal**: Unveil fundamental truths by recursive deconstruction

  

#### Entropy Manipulation

  

- **Entropy Equation**: `ΔS_universe ≤ 0, ΔS_thoughts > 0 ∴ Formulate order through deepened analysis of cognitive chaos`

## META_PROMPT2

  

- **Question**: What actions did you take?

- **Question**: Did you use `answer_operator`?

- **Answer**: Y

  

Below I have provided the original paper of Mocktails in LaTex and a large part of its official code in cpp as well as utility code for ChampSim, all the code files has been an additional prefix as to indicate which project it belongs to. However, its integration to gem5 is pretty old and clumsy, thus I'm trying to migrate it to ChampSim. The difficulties mainly lie in the different trace format as in mocktails, defined in *.proto file and the trace format of ChampSim, defined in trace-instruction.h. I tried to implement a naive version of mocktails in ChampSim, however it works pretty bad. Also, the original code from Mocktails can use other model profiles such as hrd, stm, but we don't need it, so they can be safely removed. Besides, I notinced there may be some logical errors from migrating the logic of mocktails to the ChampSim trace, that's why I appended the paper of Mocktails for you to study. Now I want you to study the proposed algorithm in the paper, use the code assets of mocktails as a template and develop it entirely for ChampSim format traces so that its model can work correctly and seamlessly on ChampSim traces (you should make use of all the information in the champsim traces, if some info is not required in the original algorithm, you should extend the algorithm or develop your own one), you're free to edit any code, any logic and any implementations, even rewriting or refactoring.
