Custom DIMMs Bring In-Memory Computing to Standard Servers

By Tom R. Halfhill

Organic brains don’t partition thinking and memory in separate hemispheres, and some computer scientists think electronic brains shouldn't either. In-
memory computing is a frontier technology that relieves the CPU-DRAM bottleneck by integrating both functions on the same chip. The main obstacles
are physical: DRAM is difficult to integrate in a conventional logic process, and logic performs poorly in a conventional DRAM process.

French startup Upmem tackles this dilemma by using massive parallelism to overcome the physical limitations of embedding logic in a DRAM chip. Its
unique data processing units (DPUs) run at only 500MHz, but each can execute 24 hardware threads. Each chip has eight DPUs and 4Gbits of DRAM.
Sixteen chips populate a memory module that’s compatible with industry-standard DIMM slots, as Figure 1 shows. Thus, each processor-in-memory
(PIM) module has 128 DPUs and 8GB of DRAM, and it can work alongside the usual DIMMs or replace them altogether.

Figure 1. Upmem processor-in-memory (PIM) module. Each module has 16 custom DRAM chips and
is compatible with industry-standard DIMM slots. It totals 128 proprietary data processing units (DPUs) and
8GB of memory.

A fully populated Intel Xeon system with six DRAM channels could amass 1,536 DPUs, 36,864 threads, and 96GB of main memory. Even larger
configurations are possible using AMD or IBM servers that have eight DRAM channels—or an IBM Power9 scale-up system with 32 channels. The host
processor offloads critical tasks to the DPUs, which enjoy intimate access to their local DRAM. Upmem says an AMD or IBM system with 2,048 DPUs,
49,152 threads, and 128GB of main memory can execute one trillion operations per second (TOPS). To verify this claim, it employed simulations and
sample chips manufactured at a Taiwanese DRAM fab since 2Q19. The first production-grade modules are scheduled to ship in October, followed by
volume production in 1Q20. When early production begins, the company plans to disclose prices, the DRAM foundry, and more performance data.

The founders presented their case for in-memory computing at the recent Hot Chips conference. Upmem claims its DPUs will typically deliver 20x better
performance on memory-intensive workloads and 10x better energy efficiency than a standard x86 server. Although the PIM modules cost more and
consume more power than standard DIMMs, their higher performance would increase efficiency and decrease the total cost of ownership (TCO) relative
to standard servers delivering equal throughput. They won't replace GPUs or FPGAs for most scientific workloads, however, because the DPUs lack
floating-point hardware. They focus mainly on pattern matching, such as database index searches, big-data graph analytic

首先需要明确一下near memory computing和in memory computing的定义，这事我和业界灌水王onur mutlu吃饭还刚过一波，结论是：真理掌握在英语表达能力范围内。┐(‘～`；)┌

很多时候这是一个参照系问题，如果严格要以in为前缀，只有把memory cell本体对信号的模拟特性的变化用于计算才是真正的in，在cell旁边加MAC都不能算，这就很苛刻了，业界除了AI有一些其他都只能算near。

实际上这某些时候是视角问题，站在CPU的角度，内存条上的运算都是in memory，哪管那么多。如果按照DIE的纬度来看，HBM包含了多层DRAM和一层logic，PIM通常会把计算逻辑放在logic层，设计上也是near但从CPU角度看也是in memory。UPMEM其实只是更进一步，把逻辑直接放到了DRAM工艺上，最靠近CELL ARRAY的位置。算IN还是算NEAR呢？

而我的定义是：只有将原本MEM器件的bandwidth具有展宽机制的才算in-memoy。举例说，在HBM2带宽256GB，在logic DIE做计算如果还是按照HBM原本接口结构用到256GB带宽，那么还是near，如果打破了DRAM DIE原本结构和接口，引入更多TSV扩大了带宽，那么这就是in-memory了。UPMEM把计算单元放到了DRAM 每个CHIP内，比DIMM条原本DDR接口获得了更大带宽，我的认定是属于in-memoy computing！

定义完成了，讲骗人<(｀^´)>

事件任何技术都是有损益的，业界的PIM看上去除了技术难度没啥损失，那这么好的东西为啥没大量商用呢？

PIM最大的障碍是memory interleave，所有PIM的议题，如果在内存交织上避而不谈的，都归入骗子，不听不听，简单直接。

一个大SOC系统，内存都不是单一的，以DDR4-3200为例，一根DIMM条的带宽是25GB，那么全芯片的总带宽200GB是8个channel交织达成的。这是为了保证最大带宽效率，以及系统在多核下的共享。以INTEL为例，多个channel的地址是按照256B为粒度交织的，即4KB的数据会拆分成16份，每个DDR channel得2份，其中为了保证系统地址更加均匀，交织还会引入更高位地址打乱，即16份中的第0份并不会固定在channel-0。

所以，每个DIMM只能拿到连续数据的一部分，并且对于交织算法的不感知，DIMM甚至无法知道自己拿到了数据的什么部分。

绝大多数的应用，都会涉及到数据的连续性，例如SORT，是不能只对部分数据进行computing的。

所以，市面上的PIM都有一个潜台词是去掉interleave，但是为了表现PIM的先进性，在性能比较时，PIM都是忽略interleave，直接和一个巨大的无需交织的单个memory比较，而这样的memory并不存在。

如果系统去掉interleave，DDR CHANNEL就需要按照核分组或者业务分组来分配channel，按照操作系统理论，实际上需要引入额外的NUMA分层，这个损失在某些业务下是很悲惨的。所以，任何PIM的方案吹嘘，如果不敢直面interleave的问题，堂堂正正讲出来其性能收益大于去掉interleave的损伤，都是骗人的。

综述：在大型SOC系统中，CPU是分布式的，memory也是分布式的，总线互联把两者联和在一起，通常无法找到一个公共点能高效解决问题。

以UPMEM为例，为了使能其功能，就需要把某特定业务的数据放到一根DIMM，假设系统是8通道交织200GB，先不考虑CACHE一致性的损伤（PIM加速的数据需要FLUSH到内存），那这个单一业务去交织后就只能得到1/8的25GB带宽了，等价于使能PIM后至少需要获得大于8倍带宽的收益才是赚的，算一算，很难噢。当然这样比较也不是特别合适，如果有8个同构，size恰当，时间上并行度也很好业务，并不会带宽受损。

额外一说，UPMEM的方案是DIMM结构，其DIMM上包含了8颗独立的DRAM芯片，每一颗都只有1/8的容量、带宽和计算能力，业务数据依旧可能分割放在了多课DRAM芯片内。UPMEM亦需要额外的DRAM芯片间的通信才能完成一个完整的运算"

## **1. Introduction to Processor-In-Memory (PIM) Computing**

**Processor-In-Memory (PIM)** computing is an architectural approach that seeks to alleviate the limitations posed by the conventional separation of processing units (CPUs) and memory. In traditional computing systems, the CPU and memory are distinct entities connected via buses. This separation often leads to a **bottleneck**, commonly referred to as the **memory wall**, where the speed disparity between the CPU and memory hinders overall system performance.

PIM aims to integrate processing capabilities directly within memory modules, enabling data processing to occur where the data resides. By minimizing data movement between memory and CPU, PIM can enhance performance, reduce latency, and improve energy efficiency for certain types of workloads, particularly those that are memory-intensive.

### **Why PIM?**

- **Data Movement Overhead**: In conventional architectures, transferring data between memory and CPU consumes significant time and energy.
- **Scalability Issues**: As data volumes grow, the inefficiency of data movement becomes more pronounced.
- **Parallelism**: PIM can exploit massive parallelism by processing data in-place, leveraging the inherent parallel nature of memory arrays.

**Specific Challenges:**

1. **Data Fragmentation**:
    - **Problem**: PIM modules often process data within a single DIMM, which may only have access to a fraction of the interleaved data.
    - **Impact**: Operations requiring large contiguous data sets (e.g., sorting) become inefficient as PIM can only access partial data blocks due to interleaving.

2. **Interleave Skipping**:
    - **Current Practice**: Many PIM solutions opt to disable interleaving to simplify processing, allowing PIM modules to access data more predictably.
    - **Consequence**: Disabling interleaving leads to reduced memory bandwidth and can negatively affect the overall system performance.

3. **Workload Isolation**:
    - **Issue**: PIM modules may require dedicating specific DIMMs to particular workloads, leading to underutilization of memory resources for other tasks.

**Author's Critique:**

- **Overstated Benefits**: PIM solutions often compare themselves against non-interleaved memory configurations, which don't exist in standard systems, leading to exaggerated performance claims.
- **NUMA Implications**: Disabling interleaving necessitates introducing NUMA-like memory hierarchies, complicating system architecture and potentially degrading performance for certain applications.

---

### **c. Bandwidth Considerations**

**Bandwidth Importance:**

- **Definition**: Bandwidth refers to the maximum rate at which data can be read from or written to memory.
- **Relevance to PIM**: High bandwidth is essential for data-intensive applications. PIM aims to maximize bandwidth by allowing data processing directly within memory modules.

**Challenges for PIM:**

1. **Bandwidth Expansion Requirement**:
    - **Scenario**: Enabling PIM within a single DIMM requires a significant increase in bandwidth to compensate for disabled interleaving.
    - **Calculation**: For example, transforming a 200GB system with 8-channel interleaving to a single DIMM with 1/8th the bandwidth would require PIM to achieve over an 8x bandwidth gain to be beneficial.

2. **Technical Limitations**:
    - **Physical Constraints**: Increasing bandwidth beyond certain limits is challenging due to electrical, thermal, and physical design limitations of memory modules.

3. **Economic Constraints**:
    - **Cost Implications**: Enhancing bandwidth entails higher manufacturing costs, making PIM modules more expensive than standard DIMMs.

**Author's Analysis:**

- **Realistic Viability**: Achieving the necessary bandwidth gains to offset interleaving losses is challenging, making PIM's economic and performance benefits uncertain.
- **Ideal vs. Realistic Conditions**: PIM's performance benefits are often touted under idealized conditions that don't account for interleaving complexities in real-world systems.

---

### **d. Compatibility with Existing Systems**

**Challenges:**

1. **Standard Interfaces**:
    - **DIMM Slots**: PIM modules must conform to standard DIMM form factors and interface specifications to be compatible with existing servers.

### **b. Memory Interleaving Mechanism**

**Conceptual Overview:**

- **Multiple Memory Channels**: Independent pathways between the CPU and memory modules to allow parallel data access.
- **Interleaving Pattern**: A systematic distribution of memory addresses across different channels to optimize bandwidth and access speed.

**Description:**

1. **Interleaving Process**:
    - **Address Division**: Memory addresses are divided into parts, with certain bits determining the memory channel for each address.
    - **Data Distribution**: Consecutive data blocks are dispersed across different memory channels.
  
2. **Benefits**:
    - **Increased Bandwidth**: Multiple channels can be accessed simultaneously, effectively multiplying the data transfer rate.
    - **Lower Latency**: Parallel access reduces wait times for memory operations.

3. **Illustrative Example**:
    - **System with 4 Memory Channels**:
        - **Addresses 0-3**: Distributed as channel-0, channel-1, channel-2, channel-3.
        - **Address 4**: Back to channel-0, continuing in a round-robin fashion.

**Illustrative Description:**

Visualize a conveyor belt system with four separate lanes (channels). As items (data blocks) move along, each consecutive item is placed into the next lane in order. This simultaneous processing across multiple lanes increases the overall throughput compared to a single lane system.
