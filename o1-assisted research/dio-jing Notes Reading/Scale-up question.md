Below is a chinese article relating to the challenges faced in "scale-up" GPU architectures, however, there are many techinical jargons and abbreviations that made me hard to understand the article as well as the figures presented, can you help me explain and draw a detailed explanation or illustrations? Thanks. "我有一个朋友，他是做AI的训练芯片，就是让Nvidia增值到3亿刀的，大号的，H100、B200，类似的。。。。。。 他最近遇到了一些技术上的困扰，但在他周边得到的反馈却往往是进度、KPI、XX比、更换参照系等等奇怪的维度的答案，所以我帮他把问题引出来，不知道能否在万能的群友中找到更技术性或更前瞻性些的答案。

  

我本不喜欢Scale-Up这个词，奈何大家都这么称呼了，所以就还是这么叫了，我们可简单把他理解为高带宽（>1TBps），不收敛，可以做内存语义访问的高性能网络吧，对应Nvidia就是Nvlink域，对应Scale-out就是Infiniband或ETH（不在本文讨论范畴）。 Nvidia的产品在Nvlink域基本上都是不收敛的，包括下图从最初的P100非对称互联，到基于V100开始基于Switch的Clos结构，再到GH200妄图用Nvlink-Network扩展但最终失败，再到最新的NVL72通过低密单板和高密Cable在最大维度达成了72颗GPU产品化的TB级别带宽的无收敛Clos交换。 （figure1.png）

  

不要小看NVL72，这其实是世界上第一个大于16P的Scale-Up无收敛产品（GH200是失败产品），而且这个产品是结合了A、B、C、D等多项工业皇冠级的技术于一体，在凑齐全部龙珠之前，想要复制它几乎是不可能的任务。

  

所以我朋友的问题来了，>16P Scale-Up AI训练芯片，该怎么做。

  

NVL72是基于Clos在单一维度的电 Cable在单平面做Scale-Up的极致，同等规模下无敌，近妖，不可复制。 任意1v1满带宽，程序猿对拓扑近似于不感知，可维可测能力超强（NVL72实际上是64/72容错）。 但正常人，面对的是基于距离的分层，层次化感。封装内部是Chiplet接口、单板上是PCB或高密Cable互联、Rack之内是中密度Cable互联（NVL72是变态高密）、Rack之外更大可能是中低密度的光互联。 即，大概率我朋友做出来的Scale-Up网络是分层次的，最上层Clos，下层。。。。。。 我知道很多人会跳出来不满意，好好一个Scale-Up网络还分层次，不爽、不爽，但是没办法啊，互联的最简单的属性是距离感，不同的距离，会有不同的最优解。只有Nvidia这把业界各项技能树点满之后搞出不分层的杂技，只能利用距离和分层来破局。 下图是典型的两种Scale-Up两分层结构（当然也可以三分层，太过了）这是16P的互联实例，因为Clos的可扩展性，实际上也能组32P、64P，规模依赖于Switch的交换能力（按x4Port算，组16P需要64Lane Switch） (figure2.png) 注：图上能效写反了，应该是pj/bit。 PlanA有点类似传统DGX，其想要的距离感是每个单板内部X/Y的平面空间，通过Cable达成超越单板出板接插件能力的内部互联（Nvidia NVL72其实是放弃了单板集成密度，也放弃了这个空间收益），然后出板打满Optical的插口数量，对接Switch。 PlanB其实有点类似NVL72，也放弃了单板的集成密度和单板内的互联空间，有点类似NVL72，但是Nvidia把这个空间用作了Grace+Hopper的紧耦合，而PlanB则放弃CPU+NPU紧耦合而用于NPUtoNPU的互联。 我列出了Chiplet、Cable、Optial三种接口的大致带宽情况，此外特别还有功耗的差异（距离就是数量级），图上单位写反了，是pj/bit。

Clos是一种全对称互联，可以基本做到编程对拓扑的不感知，友好性很好。 当然，坊间也有朋友提到Mesh、Torus之类的topology，即放弃Clos的全局对称，通过局部locality来超车Nvidia，如下图。 (figure3.png) 这也算是条路，可惜业界主流的集合通信算法在Mesh/Torus上太麻烦了，软件适配的工作量很大，这也是Dojo、Cerebras，甚至Jim Keller的Tenstorrent等芯片始终无法大量铺开的原因。 Mesh/Torus还是更适合空间计算那套路数，只能在局部空间和Nvidia能打，普适性不行。我在Torus花费了很长的时间，掉头发、掉头发，就不坑我朋友了。

  

回到PlanA/B，我帮我朋友问一句：先不考虑Mesh/Torus，基于相对通用的集合通信策略，如果我们在更长远的路径上，需要对Scale-Up分层，那PlanA和PlanB两种结构，which one Better ? • A，Cable一层+Optical一层，他们更佳的Link带宽选择是X GB/s和Y GB/s • B，Chiplet一层+Optical一层，他们更佳的Link带宽选择是M GB/s和N GB/s • C，英伟达无敌，黄教主万岁，坚决不分层，单层Clos和Transformer最配了 • D，Mesh/Torus/DF是打败英伟达的唯一解，三尺白绫送给这位朋友聊表心意

## **2. Sentence-by-Sentence Reading Comprehension and Explanation**

Now, let's dissect the article sentence by sentence to achieve a clear understanding of the content.

### **Introduction and Context**

**Original Sentence:**
"我有一个朋友，他是做AI的训练芯片，就是让Nvidia增值到3亿刀的，大号的，H100、B200，类似的。。。。。。 他最近遇到了一些技术上的困扰，但在他周边得到的反馈却往往是进度、KPI、XX比、更换参照系等等奇怪的维度的答案，所以我帮他把问题引出来，不知道能否在万能的群友中找到更技术性或更前瞻性些的答案。"

**Translation:**
"I have a friend who works on AI training chips, similar to NVIDIA's high-end products like the H100 and B200, which have increased NVIDIA's value by $300 million. Recently, he has encountered some technical challenges, but the feedback he receives from his surroundings often revolves around progress metrics, KPIs, ratios, changing reference frames, and other strange dimensions of answers. Therefore, I helped him articulate the problem, hoping to find more technical or forward-looking answers from the knowledgeable community."

**Explanation:**
The author introduces a friend involved in developing AI training chips akin to NVIDIA's H100 and B200 models. These chips have contributed significantly to NVIDIA's financial growth. The friend is currently facing technical issues, but the feedback from his peers focuses on non-technical aspects like progress indicators and performance metrics, which are not helpful for solving his technical problems. Thus, the author is seeking more technical and forward-thinking assistance from the community.

### **Defining Scale-Up**

**Original Sentence:**
"我本不喜欢Scale-Up这个词，奈何大家都这么称呼了，所以就还是这么叫了，我们可简单把他理解为高带宽（>1TBps），不收敛，可以做内存语义访问的高性能网络吧，对应Nvidia就是Nvlink域，对应Scale-out就是Infiniband或ETH（不在本文讨论范畴）。"

**Translation:**
"I don't particularly like the term 'Scale-Up,' but since everyone refers to it that way, I'll stick with it. Let's simply understand it as a high-bandwidth (>1TBps), non-convergent, high-performance network capable of semantic memory access. For NVIDIA, this corresponds to the NvLink domain, while for Scale-Out, it corresponds to Infiniband or Ethernet (not discussed in this article)."

**Explanation:**
The author expresses a preference against using the term "Scale-Up" but adopts it for consistency. He defines Scale-Up as a high-bandwidth (over 1 Terabyte per second), non-convergent (not merging or simplifying connections), high-performance network that supports semantic memory access (meaning they can process data based on memory semantics directly). In NVIDIA's terminology, this is represented by their NvLink interconnects. In contrast, Scale-Out is associated with technologies like Infiniband and Ethernet, which are not the focus of this discussion.

### **NVIDIA's Evolution in NvLink**

**Original Sentence:**
"Nvidia的产品在Nvlink域基本上都是不收敛的，包括下图从最初的P100非对称互联，到基于V100开始基于Switch的Clos结构，再到GH200妄图用Nvlink-Network扩展但最终失败，再到最新的NVL72通过低密单板和高密Cable在最大维度达成了72颗GPU产品化的TB级别带宽的无收敛Clos交换。 （figure1.png）"

**Translation:**
"NVIDIA's products in the NvLink domain are essentially non-convergent. This includes the initial P100 with asymmetric interconnects, the V100 which began utilizing Switch-based Clos structures, the GH200 which attempted to expand using NvLink-Network but ultimately failed, and the latest NVL72, which achieved a non-convergent Clos exchange with 72 GPUs at terabyte-level bandwidth through low-density boards and high-density cables. (figure1.png)"

**Explanation:**
The author outlines the progression of NVIDIA's products within the NvLink interconnect domain, emphasizing their non-convergent nature (maintaining complex, multi-path interconnections rather than simplifying them). The evolution is as follows:

1. **P100**: Utilized asymmetric interconnects, meaning the connections were not uniform or symmetric, possibly leading to inefficiencies.
2. **V100**: Introduced Switch-based Clos network structures, which are more scalable and provide non-blocking interconnections.
3. **GH200**: Attempted to further expand the NvLink-Network but ultimately failed, indicating challenges in scaling beyond certain limits.
4. **NVL72**: The latest product, successfully implementing a non-convergent Clos exchange supporting 72 GPUs with terabyte-level bandwidth. This was achieved by using low-density boards (fewer components on a board) and high-density cables (many connections per cable).

**Illustrative Description of Figure 1:**
While the actual figure is not provided, it likely illustrates the evolution of NVIDIA's NvLink interconnects from the P100 to NVL72, showing the increasing number of GPUs supported and the complexity of the interconnect architecture. It probably contrasts the asymmetric interconnects of the P100 with the more sophisticated Clos structures in the V100 and NVL72.

### **Significance of NVL72**

**Original Sentence:**
"不要小看NVL72，这其实是世界上第一个大于16P的Scale-Up无收敛产品（GH200是失败产品），而且这个产品是结合了A、B、C、D等多项工业皇冠级的技术于一体，在凑齐全部龙珠之前，想要复制它几乎是不可能的任务。"

**Translation:**
"Don't underestimate the NVL72; it is actually the world's first non-convergent Scale-Up product exceeding 16P (16 processors) (GH200 was a failed product). Moreover, this product integrates multiple industry-leading technologies labeled A, B, C, D, etc., making it almost impossible to replicate without acquiring all the Dragon Balls [mythological artifacts, implying complete mastery]."

**Explanation:**
The author emphasizes the significance of the NVL72 product, highlighting it as the first non-convergent Scale-Up interconnect supporting more than 16 processors (P stands for processors). In contrast, the GH200, which attempted to scale up, failed. NVL72's success is attributed to the integration of multiple advanced (industry "crown jewel"-level) technologies, making it very complex and highly specialized. The reference to "Dragon Balls" humorously suggests that replicating NVL72 would require extraordinary effort and possibly acquisition of all necessary advanced technologies.

### **Friend's Challenge**

**Original Sentence:**
"所以我朋友的问题来了，>16P Scale-Up AI训练芯片，该怎么做。"

**Translation:**
"So my friend's problem arises: how to develop a Scale-Up AI training chip with more than 16 processors (16P)."

**Explanation:**
Having outlined the success of NVL72 in scaling up beyond 16 processors, the author presents his friend’s challenge: designing and developing an AI training chip that can scale up to more than 16 processors. This implies a need for an advanced, non-convergent interconnect architecture capable of handling high-bandwidth, multi-GPU configurations, akin to NVL72.

### **Details on NVL72**

**Original Sentence:**
"NVL72是基于Clos在单一维度的电 Cable在单平面做Scale-Up的极致，同等规模下无敌，近妖，不可复制。 任意1v1满带宽，程序猿对拓扑近似于不感知，可维可测能力超强（NVL72实际上是64/72容错）。"

**Translation:**
"NVL72 is the pinnacle of Scale-Up based on the Clos topology, utilizing electrical cables in a single dimension on a single plane. At the same scale, it is invincible, nearly demonic, and unreplicable. It offers full bandwidth for any 1-to-1 connection, and programmers are almost oblivious to the topology. Its resilience and scalability are exceptionally strong (NVL72 is actually fault-tolerant up to 64/72 [units].)"

**Explanation:**
The NVL72 employs a Clos network topology, optimized in a single-dimensional electrical cable layout on a single plane. This design provides:

- **Invincibility and Unreplicability:** The architecture's complexity and performance make it unmatched and nearly impossible to duplicate.
- **Full Bandwidth for 1v1 Connections:** Every direct connection between two processors or GPUs can utilize the full available bandwidth, ensuring optimal performance.
- **Topology Transparency:** Programmers do not need to be aware of the network's underlying topology, simplifying software development and optimizing data access patterns.
- **Fault Tolerance:** The NVL72 can tolerate faults up to 64 out of 72 units, indicating high resilience and reliability in its interconnects.

**Terminology Clarifications:**

- **1v1 Full Bandwidth:** Refers to direct, dedicated communication links between any two units (e.g., GPUs) that do not share bandwidth with other connections, ensuring peak performance.
- **Clos Network:** A multi-stage switching network that allows for scalable and non-blocking communication between multiple nodes.
- **Fault Tolerance (64/72):** The system can continue operating correctly even if up to 64 out of 72 critical components fail, demonstrating high redundancy and reliability.

### **Network Layering and Topology**

**Original Sentence:**
"但正常人，面对的是基于距离的分层，层次化感。封装内部是Chiplet接口、单板上是PCB或高密Cable互联、Rack之内是中密度Cable互联（NVL72是变态高密）、Rack之外更大可能是中低密度的光互联。 即，大概率我朋友做出来的Scale-Up网络是分层次的，最上层Clos，下层。。。。。。 我知道很多人会跳出来不满意，好好一个Scale-Up网络还分层次，不爽、不爽，但是没办法啊，互联的最简单的属性是距离感，不同的距离，会有不同的最优解。只有Nvidia这把业界各项技能树点满之后搞出不分层的杂技，只能利用距离和分层来破局。"

**Translation:**
"But for ordinary people, it's about hierarchical layers based on distance and a sense of layering. Internally, it's Chiplet interfaces; on the board, it's PCB or high-density cable interconnects; within the rack, it's medium-density cable interconnects (NVL72 uses extremely high density); outside the rack, it's more likely medium to low-density optical interconnects. In other words, there's a high probability that the Scale-Up network my friend is developing is layered, with the top layer being the Clos network, the lower layers... I know many people will jump out dissatisfied, complaining that a proper Scale-Up network should not be layered, but there's no way around it. The simplest attribute of interconnects is the sense of distance; different distances require different optimal solutions. Only after NVIDIA has mastered all sorts of industry skills can they perform the acrobatics of non-layered interconnects, breaking through by utilizing distance and layering."

**Explanation:**
The author discusses the inherent challenges in designing Scale-Up GPU interconnect networks, emphasizing that most practical implementations must adopt a layered approach due to physical constraints related to distance. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Layered Architecture Necessity:**
    - **Chiplet Interfaces (Internal Layer):** Refers to connections between chiplets within a single chip package.

### **Plan A vs. Plan B**

**Original Sentence:**
"下图是典型的两种Scale-Up两分层结构（当然也可以三分层，太过了）这是16P的互联实例，因为Clos的可扩展性，实际上也能组32P、64P，规模依赖于Switch的交换能力（按x4Port算，组16P需要64Lane Switch） (figure2.png) 注：图上能效写反了，应该是pj/bit。"

**Translation:**
"The figure below shows two typical Scale-Up two-layered structures (of course, a three-layered one is also possible, but that would be excessive). This is an interconnect example for 16 processors (16P). Due to the scalability of Clos networks, it can actually be scaled to 32P, 64P. The scale depends on the switch's switching capacity (assuming x4Port, a 16P group requires a 64-lane switch). (figure2.png) Note: The energy efficiency in the figure is written backwards; it should be pj/bit."

**Explanation:**
The author references a figure (figure2.png) that illustrates two typical two-layered Scale-Up interconnect structures. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Interconnect Structures:**
    - **Two-Layered Structures:** These likely refer to different implementations of Scale-Up networks that utilize two distinct layers of interconnection. While not specified, one might infer that these could be variations in how interconnects are deployed within and between layers.
    - **Three-Layered Structures:** Mentioned as possible but excessive, implying increased complexity without significant additional benefits.

2. **16P Interconnect Example:**
    - **Scale-Up to 16 Processors (16P):** The figure presumably demonstrates how 16 GPUs are interconnected using a two-layered Clos network.
    - **Clos Network Scalability:** The mention of scaling to 32P and 64P indicates the inherent scalability of the Clos architecture, allowing for efficient expansion as more processors are added.

3. **Switching Capacity Dependence:**

    - **Implications for Scalability:** The ability to scale beyond 16P hinges on the switch's capacity to handle more lanes, thereby managing higher bandwidth and more simultaneous connections.

4. **Energy Efficiency Note:**
    - **Incorrect Labeling:** The author notes that the energy efficiency in the figure is mislabeled; it should be expressing energy per bit (pj/bit) instead of the opposite.
    - **Significance:** Accurate representation of energy efficiency is crucial for evaluating the performance and sustainability of interconnect architectures.

While not provided, figure2.png likely showcases two distinct two-layered interconnect designs for a 16-processor system, highlighting how Clos networks can be adapted for different scales. It might compare parameters like bandwidth, energy efficiency, and scalability across the two structures. The note about energy efficiency suggests that one aspect of the comparison involves how energy consumption scales with data transfer rates in these architectures.

### **Technical Interconnect Considerations**

**Original Sentence:**
"PlanA有点类似传统DGX，其想要的距离感是每个单板内部X/Y的平面空间，通过Cable达成超越单板出板接插件能力的内部互联（Nvidia NVL72其实是放弃了单板集成密度，也放弃了这个空间收益），然后出板打满Optical的插口数量，对接Switch。 PlanB其实有点类似NVL72，也放弃了单板的集成密度和单板内的互联空间，有点类似NVL72，但是Nvidia把这个空间用作了Grace+Hopper的紧耦合，而PlanB则放弃CPU+NPU紧耦合而用于NPUtoNPU的互联。 我列出了Chiplet、Cable、Optial三种接口的大致带宽情况，此外特别还有功耗的差异（距离就是数量级），图上单位写反了，是pj/bit。"

**Translation:**
"Plan A is somewhat similar to the traditional DGX systems. Its desired sense of distance is the X/Y planar space within each board, achieving internal interconnects that surpass the capabilities of board-level connectors using cables (NVIDIA’s NVL72 actually abandons board-integration density and sacrifices spatial benefits). Then, it fills the optical ports on the board to connect to the Switch. Plan B is somewhat similar to NVL72, also abandoning board integration density and internal interconnect space, more akin to NVL72. However, NVIDIA uses this space for the tight coupling of Grace and Hopper (Grace CPU and Hopper NPU), whereas Plan B abandons CPU-NPU tight coupling in favor of NPU to NPU interconnects. I have listed the approximate bandwidths for the three types of interfaces: Chiplet, Cable, Optical. Additionally, there are significant differences in power consumption (distance translates into orders of magnitude). The units in the figure are mislabeled; it should be pj/bit."
