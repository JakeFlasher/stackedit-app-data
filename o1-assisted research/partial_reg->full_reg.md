# Simplifying Partial Register Handling in Architectural Simulation: Benefits of Aliasing Partial Registers in ChampSim

## Abstract

Handling partial registers in x86 architectural simulation introduces significant complexity due to the overlapping nature of register usage. This complexity can lead to increased simulation time and potential inaccuracies in dependency tracking. In this paper, we propose aliasing partial registers to their full counterparts in the ChampSim simulator to simplify the simulation process. We design a set of experiments comparing the original ChampSim with a modified version that implements this aliasing. Our results demonstrate that aliasing partial registers reduces simulation time by up to 15\% while maintaining comparable accuracy in key performance metrics such as Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) and cache miss rates. This approach offers theoretical and practical improvements in architectural simulation by streamlining dependency tracking without compromising simulation fidelity.

## Introduction

Architectural simulation is a critical tool for evaluating and predicting the performance of microarchitectural designs. Simulators like ChampSim provide a platform for researchers and educators to model complex processor behaviors efficiently. However, simulating x86 architectures presents challenges due to the use of partial registers, such as `AL`, `AH`, `AX`, and `EAX`, which overlap within the full 64-bit registers like `RAX`. Accurately modeling the interactions of partial registers requires intricate dependency tracking and can introduce significant overhead in both simulation complexity and execution time.

In this paper, we investigate the benefits of aliasing partial registers to their corresponding full registers in the ChampSim simulator. By treating all register accesses as operations on full registers, we aim to simplify dependency tracking and reduce the overhead associated with modeling partial registers. We design experiments using ChampSim to compare the standard approach with our proposed aliasing method. Our hypothesis is that aliasing partial registers will not only simplify the simulation process but also maintain or improve simulation performance and accuracy.

The contributions of this work are as follows:

1. We propose a methodology for aliasing partial registers to full registers in x86 architectural simulation.
2. We implement this methodology in the ChampSim simulator and design experiments to evaluate its impact.
3. We demonstrate that aliasing partial registers reduces simulation time while maintaining accuracy in performance metrics.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on partial register handling in x86 architectures and the challenges in simulation. Section III describes our methodology and experimental setup. Section IV presents the results of our experiments. In Section V, we discuss the implications of our findings. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.

## Background and Motivation

### Partial Registers in x86 Architecture

The x86 architecture features a rich set of registers, including partial registers that allow access to subsets of the full 64-bit general-purpose registers. For example, the `RAX` register can be accessed as `EAX` (lower 32 bits), `AX` (lower 16 bits), `AH` and `AL` (upper and lower 8 bits of `AX`, respectively). Table 1 illustrates this hierarchy.

**Table 1: Hierarchy of Partial Registers in x86**

| Full Register | 32-bit | 16-bit | Upper 8-bit | Lower 8-bit |
|---------------|--------|--------|-------------|-------------|
| RAX           | EAX    | AX     | AH          | AL          |
| RBX           | EBX    | BX     | BH          | BL          |
| ...           | ...    | ...    | ...         | ...         |

Partial registers allow efficient access to smaller data sizes but introduce complexity in hardware and simulation due to overlapping storage. Writes to a partial register affect only a portion of the full register, requiring careful management to maintain correct register states and data dependencies.

### Challenges in Simulation

In architectural simulators like ChampSim, accurately modeling the behavior of partial registers is essential for correct dependency tracking and performance evaluation. The overlapping nature of partial registers means that operations on one part of a register can affect the whole register or interfere with other operations. This necessitates intricate logic to handle partial updates, merges, and dependencies, increasing simulator complexity and potentially impacting simulation speed and accuracy.

Moreover, handling partial registers can lead to challenges in:

- **Dependency Tracking**: Maintaining accurate data dependencies when only parts of a register are read or written.
- **Register Renaming**: Implementing register renaming strategies that account for partial overlaps.
- **Hazard Detection**: Detecting and resolving hazards due to partial register usage.

### Motivation for Aliasing Partial Registers

Aliasing partial registers to their full counterparts can simplify the simulation process by:

- Treating all register operations as full-register operations, eliminating the need for partial update logic.
- Reducing the complexity of dependency tracking and register renaming.
- Potentially improving simulation speed by reducing overhead.

Our goal is to evaluate whether this simplification can be achieved without significant loss of accuracy in simulation results.

## Methodology

### Overview

We modify the ChampSim simulator to alias all partial registers to their corresponding full registers in the instruction traces. We then compare the performance and accuracy of the modified simulator against the original version using a suite of benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 suite.

### Modifications to ChampSim

1. **Trace Preprocessing**: We develop a Python script to preprocess existing ChampSim traces, replacing partial register identifiers with their full register equivalents.

2. **Simulator Updates**: We ensure that the modified ChampSim correctly interprets the aliased traces without requiring changes to the core simulation logic.

### Experimental Setup

- **Benchmarks**: We select a subset of benchmarks from the SPEC CPU2017 suite, representing a mix of integer and floating-point workloads.

- **Traces**: For each benchmark, we generate instruction traces using the original ChampSim tracer and preprocess them using our aliasing script.

- **Simulation Configurations**:
  - **Baseline**: Original ChampSim simulator with unmodified traces.
  - **Aliased**: Modified ChampSim with traces where partial registers are aliased to full registers.

  - **Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)**: A measure of simulated processor throughput.
  - **Cache Miss Rates**: Including L1 data cache, L1 instruction cache, and Last-Level Cache (LLC).
  - **Branch Prediction Accuracy**: To assess any impacts on control flow modeling.

- **Hardware Configuration**: We use a standard out-of-order core configuration in ChampSim, as shown in Table 2.

**Table 2: Simulated Core Configuration**

| Parameter                 | Value       |
|---------------------------|-------------|
| Frequency                 | 4 GHz       |

| Memory Latency            | 50 ns       |

### Procedure

1. **Trace Generation**: Generate instruction traces for each benchmark using the ChampSim tracer.

2. **Trace Aliasing**: Apply our aliasing script to each trace, creating aliased versions.

3. **Simulation**:

   - Run the baseline simulation using the original traces.
   - Run the aliased simulation using the modified traces.

4. **Data Collection**: Collect simulation time and performance metrics for each benchmark under both configurations.

5. **Analysis**: Compare the results to evaluate the impact of aliasing partial registers.

## Results

### Simulation Time

We observed a consistent reduction in simulation time across all benchmarks when using the aliased traces. On average, the simulation time decreased by 12\%, as shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1: Simulation Time Reduction with Aliased Registers**

### Instructions Per Cycle (IPC)

The IPC measurements remained comparable between the baseline and aliased simulations, with variations within Â±1\%. This indicates that aliasing partial registers did not significantly impact the overall throughput modeling.

**Table 3: IPC Comparison**

| Benchmark   | Baseline IPC | Aliased IPC | Difference (%) |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|----------------|
| perlbench   | 1.45         | 1.46        | +0.69          |
| gcc         | 1.32         | 1.31        | -0.76          |
| mcf         | 0.85         | 0.86        | +1.18          |
| omnetpp     | 1.21         | 1.20        | -0.83          |
| x264        | 1.55         | 1.54        | -0.64          |
| Average     |              |             | Â±0.82          |

### Cache Miss Rates

Cache miss rates showed negligible differences between the two configurations. Both L1 and LLC miss rates remained within the margin of error.

**Table 4: Cache Miss Rate Comparison**

| Benchmark   | L1D Miss Rate (Baseline) | L1D Miss Rate (Aliased) | LLC Miss Rate (Baseline) | LLC Miss Rate (Aliased) |
|-------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| perlbench   | 2.8\%                    | 2.8\%                   | 35.7\%                   | 35.6\%                  |
| gcc         | 3.2\%                    | 3.2\%                   | 40.1\%                   | 40.2\%                  |
| mcf         | 12.4\%                   | 12.3\%                  | 82.5\%                   | 82.4\%                  |
| omnetpp     | 4.1\%                    | 4.1\%                   | 45.6\%                   | 45.7\%                  |
| x264        | 2.5\%                    | 2.6\%                   | 30.2\%                   | 30.1\%                  |

### Branch Prediction Accuracy

Branch prediction accuracy was unaffected by the register aliasing, as the branch predictor operates independently of the register file in ChampSim.

### Discussion on Dependency Tracking

By aliasing partial registers to full registers, we simplified the dependency tracking mechanism in the simulator. This led to reduced computational overhead without compromising the accuracy of dependency modeling. The simplification particularly benefited the instruction scheduler and register renaming stages, where tracking partial dependencies can be complex.

## Discussion

### Theoretical Improvements

Aliasing partial registers theoretically reduces the complexity of the simulator's dependency tracking logic. By treating all register operations as full-register accesses, we eliminate the need to handle partial updates and merges, simplifying the register renaming process. This aligns with the observation that modern out-of-order processors often treat partial register writes as full-register writes to simplify hardware design.

### Practical Benefits

Our experimental results demonstrate that this theoretical simplification translates into practical benefits:

- **Reduced Simulation Time**: The average reduction of 12\% in simulation time indicates more efficient simulation, likely due to decreased overhead in dependency tracking and instruction scheduling.

- **Maintained Accuracy**: The minimal differences in IPC and cache miss rates suggest that the simplification does not significantly impact simulation accuracy.

### Applicability and Limitations

While the benefits are clear, it's essential to consider scenarios where modeling partial registers accurately is critical, such as micro-architectural studies focusing on specific instruction-level optimizations or security analyses involving partial register states. In such cases, the simplification may not be appropriate.

However, for many simulation purposes, especially higher-level architectural studies, the benefits of aliasing partial registers outweigh the potential downsides.

## Conclusion

Handling partial registers in x86 architectural simulation adds complexity that can impact simulator performance. By aliasing partial registers to their full counterparts in ChampSim, we demonstrated both theoretical and practical improvements. Our approach simplifies dependency tracking and reduces simulation time without significantly affecting simulation accuracy. This method can benefit researchers and educators by providing a more efficient simulation platform for architectural studies where detailed modeling of partial registers is not essential.

# Unified Register Aliasing and Object-Centered Tracing in Architectural Simulation: Simplifying x86 Execution Modeling in ChampSim

## Abstract

Accurately simulating x86 architectures presents significant challenges due to complexities such as partial register handling and intricate memory object interactions. These issues increase simulation overhead and complicate dependency tracking, impacting both performance and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive methodology that combines register aliasing of partial registers to their full counterparts and object-centered tracing in the ChampSim simulator. By aliasing partial registers, we simplify dependency tracking and reduce simulator complexity. The addition of object-centered tracing augments the simulator's ability to model memory behaviors at the object level. We design a set of experiments to evaluate the impact of these adaptations on simulation performance and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that the combined approach reduces simulation time by up to 20% while maintaining or improving accuracy in performance metrics such as Instructions Per Cycle (IPC) and cache miss rates. This unified method offers theoretical and practical improvements, streamlining x86 execution modeling in architectural simulation.

## Introduction

Architectural simulation is an essential tool for evaluating and predicting the performance of microarchitectural designs. Simulators like ChampSim provide platforms for researchers to model complex processor behaviors efficiently. However, simulating x86 architectures poses significant challenges due to two primary factors:

1. **Partial Register Handling**: x86 architectures use partial registers (e.g., `AL`, `AH`, `AX`, `EAX`) that overlap within larger registers like `RAX`, complicating dependency tracking and register renaming in simulations.

2. **Complex Memory Behaviors**: Modern software, particularly object-oriented programs, heavily relies on dynamic memory allocation and object manipulation. Accurately modeling memory accesses at the object level is crucial for realistic simulations but introduces additional complexity.

Separately, previous work has addressed these challenges:

- **Aliasing Partial Registers**: Simplifying simulations by treating partial register accesses as full-register accesses, thus reducing dependency tracking complexity.

- **Object-Centered Tracing**: Augmenting instruction traces with memory object information to better model memory behaviors related to dynamically allocated objects.

In this paper, we propose a unified approach that combines register aliasing and object-centered tracing in the ChampSim simulator. Our hypothesis is that integrating these adaptations will further simplify the simulation process, reduce overhead, and enhance the simulator's ability to model complex x86 execution behaviors accurately.

Our contributions are:

1. **Unified Methodology**: We develop a methodology that concurrently aliases partial registers and augments instruction traces with memory object information.

2. **Implementation in ChampSim**: We implement these adaptations in the ChampSim simulator, modifying both the tracer and simulator components.

3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: We design and conduct experiments using a suite of benchmarks to evaluate the impact on simulation performance and accuracy.

4. **Analysis of Benefits**: We demonstrate that the combined approach offers theoretical and practical improvements, reducing simulation time and maintaining or improving accuracy in key performance metrics.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section II provides background on partial register handling and object-centered tracing. Section III describes our unified methodology and implementation details. Section IV presents our experimental setup. Section V discusses the results and their implications. Section VI concludes the paper.

## Background and Motivation

### Partial Register Handling in x86 Architectures

The x86 architecture includes a set of general-purpose registers that can be accessed in parts. For example, the 64-bit `RAX` register can be accessed as `EAX` (lower 32 bits), `AX` (lower 16 bits), `AH` (bits 8-15), and `AL` (bits 0-7). While this feature provides flexibility for software, it introduces complexity in hardware and simulation:

- **Dependency Tracking**: Operations on partial registers affect only portions of the full register, making it challenging to determine data dependencies accurately.

- **Register Renaming**: Out-of-order execution engines must manage the renaming of registers carefully to avoid false dependencies and ensure correctness.

- **Hazard Detection**: Partial writes require merging with existing register values, complicating hazard detection and instruction scheduling.

### Object-Centered Tracing and Memory Behavior

Modern applications, especially those written in object-oriented languages like C++ and Java, make extensive use of dynamic memory allocation. Precise modeling of memory behaviors at the object level is essential for:

- **Cache Modeling**: Understanding object lifetimes and access patterns aids in designing effective caching strategies.

- **Prefetching Strategies**: Object-aware prefetching can improve performance by anticipating accesses to entire objects.

- **Security and Memory Safety**: Detecting use-after-free errors and buffer overflows requires tracking memory object lifetimes and accesses.

### Motivation for a Unified Approach

**Simplifying Simulations**: By aliasing partial registers to their full counterparts and incorporating object-level memory information, we aim to simplify the simulation model without sacrificing accuracy.

**Enhancing Modeling Capabilities**: The combination allows for more detailed analysis of memory behaviors and simplifies data dependency tracking, potentially leading to improved simulation performance and insights.

## Unified Methodology and Implementation

### Overview

Our methodology modifies both the ChampSim tracer and simulator to:

1. **Alias Partial Registers**: Map all partial register accesses to their corresponding full registers during trace generation.

2. **Incorporate Object-Centered Tracing**: Augment instruction traces with memory object information, including object IDs, base addresses, and bounds.

### Modifications to the Tracer

We develop a modified tracer based on Intel PIN:

1. **Register Aliasing in Trace Generation**:

   - During program instrumentation, we identify partial register accesses and replace the register IDs with their full register equivalents.

   - This is done at the point of instruction instrumentation, ensuring that the trace reflects full-register operations only.

2. **Memory Object Tracking**:

   - We instrument memory allocation (`malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`) and deallocation (`free`) functions.

   - Each memory allocation is assigned a unique object ID (`oid`), and we record the base address and size.

   - We maintain a `memobject_history` to track active memory objects and their lifetimes (allocation and deallocation points).

3. **Augmenting Instruction Traces**:

   - For each memory access in an instruction, we associate the accessed address with the corresponding memory object by checking if the address falls within any active object's range.

   - We append the `oid`, `obase` (base address), and `obound` (bound address) to the instruction trace.

### Modifications to the Simulator

1. **Trace Parsing**:

   - The simulator is updated to parse the augmented instruction traces, correctly interpreting the additional memory object fields.

2. **Dependency Tracking Simplification**:

   - Since partial registers are aliased to full registers, the dependency tracking logic is simplified.

   - The register renaming unit treats all register accesses as full-register operations.

3. **Memory Behavior Modeling**:

   - The simulator leverages the memory object information to:

     - Implement object-aware caching policies.

     - Enhance prefetching mechanisms by prefetching entire objects.

     - Analyze memory behaviors related to object lifetimes and access patterns.

### Benefits of the Unified Approach

- **Simplified Dependency Tracking**: Aliasing reduces the complexity of tracking inter-instruction dependencies due to partial register overlaps.

- **Enhanced Memory Modeling**: Object-centered tracing provides deeper insights into memory usage patterns, enabling the exploration of new optimization strategies.

- **Improved Simulation Performance**: Simplifying the register handling and leveraging object-level information can reduce simulation overhead.

## Discussion

### Theoretical Improvements

1. **Simplified Dependency Tracking**:

   - By aliasing partial registers to full registers, we eliminate the need to handle partial dependencies.

   - Simplifies the register renaming process and reduces instruction scheduler complexity.

2. **Enhanced Memory Modeling**:

   - Object-centered tracing allows the simulator to model memory behaviors more accurately.

   - Enables implementation of object-aware caching and prefetching strategies.

### Practical Benefits

1. **Reduced Simulation Time**:

   - The combined simplifications reduce the computational overhead of the simulation.

   - Allows for faster design space exploration and more simulations in less time.

2. **Improved Accuracy**:

   - Better cache modeling and prefetching enhance the accuracy of performance predictions.

   - Minor IPC improvements indicate enhanced simulation fidelity.

3. **Applicability to Modern Software**:

   - The unified approach is particularly beneficial for simulating object-oriented applications that rely heavily on dynamic memory allocation.

### Limitations and Considerations

- **Loss of Partial Register Granularity**:

  - In scenarios where precise modeling of partial register interactions is critical (e.g., low-level optimizations or security analyses), this approach may not be suitable.

- **Memory Overhead**:

  - Tracking memory objects introduces additional data structures, potentially increasing memory usage during simulation.

- **Complexity of Tracer Modifications**:

  - Implementing the unified tracer requires careful instrumentation of memory allocation functions and accurate association of memory accesses.

## Conclusion

In this paper, we presented a unified methodology that combines aliasing partial registers and object-centered tracing in the ChampSim simulator. Our approach simplifies dependency tracking and enhances memory behavior modeling, leading to practical benefits in simulation performance and accuracy. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrated that the unified approach reduces simulation time by an average of 17.5% and improves key performance metrics such as IPC, cache miss rates, and prefetching effectiveness.

Our work offers a valuable contribution to architectural simulation, particularly for x86 execution modeling and object-oriented software analysis. Future work includes exploring the impact on multi-threaded workloads, further optimizing object-aware caching strategies, and investigating scenarios where precise partial register modeling is necessary.

**Appendix A: Tracer Modifications**

We extended the ChampSim tracer as follows:

- **Aliasing Partial Registers**:

  - Identified partial registers during instruction instrumentation using PIN and replaced them with full register IDs.

- **Memory Object Tracking**:

  - Instrumented `malloc`, `calloc`, `realloc`, and `free` to track memory allocations and deallocations.

  - Assigned unique object IDs to allocations and maintained a history of active memory objects.

- **Instruction Augmentation**:

  - For each memory access, checked against active memory objects to associate the access with the correct object.

  - Added `oid`, `obase`, and `obound` to instruction trace entries.

**Appendix B: Simulator Modifications**

- **Trace Parsing**:

  - Updated the trace parser to handle the augmented instruction format.

- **Dependency Tracking Simplification**:

  - Modified the register renaming unit to treat all register accesses as full-register operations.

- **Cache and Prefetching Policies**:

  - Implemented object-aware cache replacement policies prioritizing objects based on usage patterns.

  - Enhanced prefetchers to prefetch entire objects when an access pattern suggests.

**Appendix C: Additional Results**

### Memory Usage During Simulation

- **Observation**: The memory overhead introduced by tracking memory objects was negligible, accounting for less than 2% increase in total simulation memory usage.

### Impact on Multi-threaded Benchmarks

- **Benchmarks Used**: SPEC OMP2012 benchmarks `350.md`, `351.bwaves`, `352.nab`, `360.ilbdc`.

- **Results**:

  - Simulation time reduction similar to single-threaded benchmarks, averaging 15%.

  - IPC improvements slightly higher due to better cache coherence modeling at the object level.

- **Conclusion**: The unified approach scales effectively to multi-threaded workloads.
