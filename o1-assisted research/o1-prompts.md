Below are some of the libraries that deals with the champsim format traces, the main file filter_rd_olken.cc reads from a trace, calculate the reuse distance for every instruction and then filter some of the instructions into a log file for later use. The olken.h is the library for calculating the reuse distance using olken splay tree algorithm. Since now we're shifting from traditional analytical algorithm into deep learning or even using LLMs, so I'd like to migrate the infrastructures into pytorch version. However, since my knowledge is limited regards deep learning models, the first thing I could think of is using pandas.dataframe to read a csv file. Thus, I'll need some help to convert the original champsim trace into a csv file. Since such a csv file may be huge, I'm thinking using the zip compression to store such a csv. The detailed requirements is as follows: "1. We'll store only the interested fields decoded from the orignal trace using champsim trace decoder, i.e. IP, address, opcode, for opcode, you need to identify branch taken or branch not taken instead of just using branch, pease modify the champsim trace decoder to do so. 2. Two other related fileds needs to be calculated or read from other sources, RD(reuse distance) and instruction IPC (read from simulating result file, the format of a result file is given). RD is calculated using olken.h as shown in the filter_rd_olken.cc and the instruction IPC is read from a result file from simulator, which is given as an argument, in the log file, there are lines saying: "Heartbeat CPU 0 instructions: 5000005 cycles: 2647076 heartbeat IPC: 3.85 cumulative IPC: 1.889 (Simulation time: 00 hr 00 min 36 sec)

Heartbeat CPU 0 instructions: 6000005 cycles: 2908668 heartbeat IPC: 3.823 cumulative IPC: 2.063 (Simulation time: 00 hr 00 min 41 sec)

Heartbeat CPU 0 instructions: 7000007 cycles: 3169840 heartbeat IPC: 3.829 cumulative IPC: 2.208 (Simulation time: 00 hr 00 min 45 sec)

Heartbeat CPU 0 instructions: 8000009 cycles: 3430182 heartbeat IPC: 3.841 cumulative IPC: 2.332 (Simulation time: 00 hr 00 min 49 sec)

" Where the Heartbeat CPU 0 instructions: 8000009 indicates the instruction index and the heartbeat IPC is the instruction IPC for this instruction. After that, the column RD and IPC should be appended into the original csv. 3. Sanity check and Store the whole csv as a zip compressed file. Since there may be some skipped instruction that doesn't get executed in the simulation and thus there's no IPC count for them. You need to output the total number of such IPC values missing and find a way to fill them in (e.g. using the previous instruction's IPC value or calculate the mean value) " This is the whole workflow currently coming to my mind, however, I'm not quite familiar with pytorch dataset, can you help me examine the whole process and optimize them? Most importantly, is csv the only option for feeding data into pytorch or are there any better alternatives? Thanks. You can find below the related cpp files.

  
  

Below is the re-organized code I've made some minor adaptations to make it work. Several things to note here. First, since the data structure of unordered_map is unordered, thus the lower_bound function doesn't exist, and will produce the following error: "‘class std::unordered_map<long unsigned int, double>’ has no member named ‘lower_bound’". Second, CSVs need you to read the entire file to query just one column, which is highly inefficient. On the other hand, Parquet's columnar storage and efficient compression makes it well-suited for analytical queries that only need to access specific columns. However, for training pytorch modles on a HPC, the memory is 2TB thus fairly enough, and since all the data needs to be read, there's no need to use other format than csv. So far for as long as I'm testing, the usage of json.hpp is way too slow. Thus, I need you to modify it to output as a csv instead. Third, I want you to include branch taken and branch not taken into opcode, instead of setting another column named branch_taken since it is only meaningful when encountering a branch instruction. Thus you need to modify the ins_'s data structure within the propagator.h file. Please re-examine all the uploaded files carefully and output the best-quality code you can do!

  
  

Thanks for your help. However, the problem is: the original simulation result file is quite porous/sparse, e.g. if I simunate 1000 instructions, the result file consists of only 500 instructions that has an IPC value. If I simulate 10000 instructions, the result file contains of only 3000 instructions with IPC. Thus, simply using the previous may not be the appropriate approach since there may be a big gap of long sequence of blank IPC values. Thus I need you to use advanced numerical methods and mathemathics to deal with it. Also, the updated code doesn't correctly count the number of missing values of IPC, it will always output 0 missing values. Please fix it.

Another part is after data collection, what kind of deep learning or LLMs finetuning formula in pytorch is
