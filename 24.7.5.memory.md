### A glimpse

[Optimizing AI Inference at Character.AI](https://research.character.ai/optimizing-inference/) mentions a highly efficient framework for LLM inference, consisting of the following three parts: 
1.  **Multi-Query Attention (MQA)**: Using a single key for all queries.
2.  **Hybrid Architecture**: Some layers have global attention, while others have only local attention.
3.  **Hierarchical Cache**: Storing the KV cache in memory close to the GPU. During inference, a model determines which KV entries are important and retrieves them to the GPU.

*Figure 1. Left: Standard transformer design where every attention is global attention. Right: The attention design in our production model. Blue boxes indicate global attention, green boxes indicate local attention, and curves indicate KV-sharing. For global attention layers, we share KV across multiple non-adjacent layers. This illustration depicts only a subset of the layers in the full model.*

## #3. Workspace tested on *HPC-gz* 
> Due to memory/Hard drive space limit, had to move the current workspace to hpc for faster, parallel executions
- 1. *Dockerhub.io* wasn't working on vm-hpcs, had to download docker image for use from ghrc.io. 
- 2. All tools tested with *SPEC2017* benchmarks (profiling, tracing, simulators etc.)
