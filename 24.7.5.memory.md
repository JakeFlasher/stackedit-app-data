# Overview
> - Optimized the proposed workflow.
> - Learning from *character.ai*. (quantized attention tuned and spaecialized for very long context length and high industrial throughput) 
> - Workspace tested and pushed to *HPC.docker.io*.

### Basic Block Profiling from ASM

1. Obtain simpoints/weights and corresponding bbvs
2. Using the above method to generate detailed ASM/Traces at the simpoints (based on bbv)
3. Do something with the generated ASM/Traces
4. Extrapolate the results based on  3. and weights

## Workspace tested on *HPC-gz* 
> Due to memory/Hard drive space limit, had to move the current workspace to hpc for faster, parallel executions
- 1. *Dockerhub.io* wasn't working on vm-hpcs, had to download docker image for use from ghrc.io. 
- 2. All tools tested with *SPEC2017* benchmarks (profiling, tracing, simulators etc.)
