## For the first time, introduce the concept of "time-domain" and "freq-domain" in workload synthesis
### Time-domain 
1. Examples: Sniper, Simpoints, Smarts
2. Accurate in overall ipc measurement
3. 
### Frequency-domain 
1. Examples: HRD, mocktails, WEST
2. Preserve average behavior, Faster than time-domain method (1/10 synthesis ratio)
3. Can not model phase transition (ipc curve, memory access patterns)
## "Time-domain" -> "Freq-domain" -> "Time-domain"
### Necessity Analysis
### Sufficient Analysis
