**Solution Check and Explanation (in English)**

Below, I will first summarize the core idea of the solution found in your provided markdown document (whose content is in Chinese), verify its correctness from a statistical perspective, and explain why the Poisson distribution is a suitable choice for approximating the probability of having a run of at least \(n\) consecutive heads in 10,000 fair coin tosses. Then, I will draw an analogy from this “maximum run-length problem” to the domain of memory access patterns (e.g., modeling reuse distance or reuse interval in GPU kernels) and show how a similar Poisson-based approach (or related stochastic approach) could be applied.

---

## 1. Verifying the Provided Solution

### 1.1. Problem Restatement

1. We toss a fair coin \(10{,}000\) times (i.e., each toss has a probability of \(1/2\) of being heads).  
2. We want to know: among all possible run lengths of consecutive heads, which run length \(n\) is the most likely to be the longest run we see? Equivalently, for which \(n\) is  
   \[
   P(\text{Maximum consecutive heads} = n)
   \]
   maximized?

### 1.2. Poisson Approximation

The original solution notes that the exact calculation can be very involved (e.g., considering a Markov chain with “absorption” when hits of \(n\)-long heads occur, or enumerating probabilities). Instead, it applies a common stochastic-process trick by approximating the number of occurrences of “\(n\)-length runs” as a Poisson random variable. Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Small-Probability, Large-Number Events**:  
   The event “a particular block of \(n\) consecutive tosses is all heads” has probability \(2^{-n}\). So for large \(n\), each block is a relatively rare event.

2. **Approximate Independence**:  
   Although runs can overlap, if we look at well-separated locations in the sequence of 10,000 tosses, the events “there is an \(n\)-length run starting at position \(k\)” and “there is an \(n\)-length run starting at position \(j\)” (for \(k\) sufficiently far from \(j\)) are approximately independent. This is not perfect, but usually acceptable for large-scale approximations.

3. **Parameter \(\lambda_n\)**:  
   To form the count of \(n\)-length runs as a Poisson random variable, the only missing piece is the parameter \(\lambda_n\). The solution estimates the expected number of occurrences of \(n\)-consecutive-heads blocks by noticing that an “\(n\)-consecutive-heads block” occurs whenever:
   - The first of those \(n\) tosses is heads.  
   - The previous toss (if it exists) is tails (so that the run indeed “starts” at that position).  
   - The next \(n-1\) tosses are also heads.

   Hence, the probability that position \(i\) is the start of an \(n\)-length run of heads is \(\tfrac{1}{2^{n+1}}\) (because we require the previous toss to be tails with probability \(\tfrac12\), then \(n\) consecutive heads with probability \(\tfrac{1}{2^n}\)). Multiplying by ~10,000 for all possible starting locations provides an approximate mean:
   \[
   \lambda_n \approx 10{,}000 \times 2^{-(n+1)}.
   \]

4. **Poisson Probability**:  
   Let \(X_n\) be the (random) number of runs of length \(\ge n\). We assume \(X_n\) is Poisson\((\lambda_n)\). The probability of having at least one such run is:
   \[
   1 - P(X_n = 0) = 1 - e^{-\lambda_n}.
   \]
   Therefore,
   \[
   P(\text{Max run} \ge n) \approx 1 - e^{-\,10{,}000 \cdot 2^{-(n+1)}}.
   \]

5. **Probability that the Max is Exactly \(n\)**:  
   \[
   P(M=n) \;=\; P(M \ge n) \;-\; P(M \ge n+1).
   \]
   Substituting the approximate Poisson form:
   \[
   P(M = n) \approx \bigl(1 - e^{-\,10{,}000 \cdot 2^{-(n+1)}}\bigr)\;-\;\bigl(1 - e^{-\,10{,}000 \cdot 2^{-(n+2)}}\bigr) 
   \;=\; e^{-\,10{,}000 \cdot 2^{-(n+2)}} \;-\; e^{-\,10{,}000 \cdot 2^{-(n+1)}}.
   \]

### 1.3. Finding the \(n\) that Maximizes \(P(M=n)\)

The solution then treats \(n\) as approximately continuous to take a derivative with respect to \(n\) and set it to zero. Solving  
\[
e^{-10000 \cdot 2^{-(n+2)}} = 2 \, e^{-10000 \cdot 2^{-(n+1)}}
\]
leads to
\[
n_0 \approx -\log_2\!\Bigl(\tfrac{\ln 2}{10000}\Bigr) - 2 \;\approx\; 11.82,
\]
which is around 12. This means \(n=12\) is the integer that (under this approximation) maximizes \(P(M = n)\).

### 1.4. Correctness of the Approach

1. **Well-Known Stochastic Limit**:  
   The Poisson approximation for “the number of occurrences of a rare event” in a large sequence (or large time window) is a textbook principle (akin to the “law of rare events”).  

2. **Validity Checks**:  
   - When \(n\) is too small, the run is not so rare, so the Poisson approximation might slightly deviate.  
   - When \(n\) is large, occurrences become *very* rare, so again boundary effects might appear.  
   - However, around the interesting range (around 10–15 for 10,000 coin flips), the approximation is usually quite good.  

3. **Observed Empirics**:  
   Many numerical simulations (or actual game match records) show that the most frequent length of the longest consecutive wins (heads) in a ~10k sample indeed hovers around 11–14. Getting around 12 as a sweet spot is consistent with simulation results.  

Thus, from a statistical perspective, the provided solution is both a *reasonable* and *commonly accepted* way to tackle “maximum consecutive successes” type problems in large Bernoulli trials.

## 2. Why Poisson Distribution Is a Good Fit

The Poisson distribution naturally arises in scenarios where we have:

1. **A large number of trials** (e.g., 10,000 coin tosses).  
2. **Small probability events** in each trial (e.g., “we start an \(n\)-run of heads at position \(i\)”).  
3. **Approximate independence** among well-separated events.

Such conditions fit the “Poisson paradigm” or “law of small numbers,” yielding a sum (count) of rare events that is approximately Poisson-distributed.  

Other possible approaches:

- **Exact Markov Chain**: One can formulate a Markov chain of “current run length of heads” with an absorbing state once you hit \(n\). Then to find the probability of eventually hitting that absorbing state within 10,000 tosses, you would need to iterate the transition matrix \(\approx 10{,}000\) times, which is quite large. This is more precise but computationally intensive.  
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Repeatedly simulate 10,000 tosses, collect statistics for the longest run, and approximate the distribution. This is easy but not purely analytic.  
- **De-Poisson Binomial / Inclusion-Exclusion**: You could try an inclusion-exclusion argument for “at least one run of length \(\ge n\)” but that gets complicated quickly for large sequences.  

Among these, the Poisson approximation offers an elegant balance of mathematical tractability and practical accuracy.

## 3. Analogy to Memory Access Patterns

You asked for “a formulation of the problem of memory access patterns, akin to the coin toss problem, and a demonstration of how Poisson can be a suitable candidate.” Let’s construct a scenario:

### 3.1. Memory Access Patterns: Reuse Distance or Reuse Interval

- **Reuse Distance** (or “stack distance”) is typically defined as: “Between two consecutive accesses to the same data element (say an integer in memory), how many *distinct* data elements were accessed?”  
- **Reuse Interval** is a related notion but simpler: “Between two consecutive accesses to the same data element, how many total memory accesses (not necessarily distinct) occurred?”

For certain GPU performance models, we want to know the distribution of reuse intervals of each data element, because if the reuse interval is very large, the data might be evicted from cache, whereas if it is small, the data might stay in a faster memory structure.

#### 3.1.1. Formulating the Event

Suppose we have a data array of size \(N\). A kernel randomly (or pseudo-randomly) accesses data in that array over a large sequence of total memory accesses (say \(M\) accesses, with \(M \gg N\)). Each access picks an array index according to some distribution (not necessarily uniform, but let’s simplify to uniform for illustration).

We might be interested in the event “a particular data element \(d\) is *not* accessed at all in a consecutive block of size \(k\).” That would represent a ‘run’ of length \(k\) where \(d\) is absent from the accesses. If \(k\) is large, that means once we used data element \(d\), it took a long time before it was accessed again—i.e., a large reuse interval.

### 3.2. Mapping to “Run of Heads”

Think of “Heads” ↔ “Accessing the data item \(d\).” The probability of a “Head” event on each memory reference is roughly \(1/N\) if each of the \(N\) data items is equally likely to be accessed. Then:

- **Run of Heads** in the coin world  
  → “Consecutive accesses to \(d\)” in the memory world.  

- **But** in the memory context, we might be equally (or more) interested in a “run of Tails” = “run of *not* accessing \(d\),” i.e., how long does it go before we see the data item again? This is akin to a “reuse distance/interval.”

Hence, it’s possible to look at “long runs” (in time) in which \(d\) does not appear. If that run is very long, from the perspective of a cache, it means \(d\) is likely evicted.

### 3.3. Poisson Approximation for Long Intervals

Now, define an indicator random variable:
\[
I_j = \begin{cases}
1, & \text{if a run of length } k \text{ (missing } d\text{) starts at access } j,\\
0, & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
\]
The probability that “starting from reference \(j\), the next \(k\) accesses all skip element \(d\)” is roughly \(\bigl(1 - \frac1N\bigr)^k\). If \(k\) is large, that might be a small probability. Over \(M\) total accesses, the *expected* number of such runs is about
\[
\lambda_k \;\approx\; M \,\times\, \Bigl(1-\tfrac1N\Bigr)^k \,\times\, \Bigl(\tfrac{1}{N}\Bigr) \,?
\]
(We’d adjust slightly if we require that “the previous access was actually \(d\)” or “the next run is strictly disjoint,” etc. The exact form depends on how precisely we define “starting a run of length \(k\) missing \(d\).”)

If we assume approximate independence (i.e., well-separated intervals in the memory trace), then the count of such runs can again be modeled by a Poisson distribution. In that case:
\[
P(\text{At least one such run of length } k) \;\approx\; 1 \;-\; e^{-\lambda_k}.
\]
Finally, if we want the maximum length of a “gap” (i.e., the maximum reuse interval for \(d\) under such an assumption), we can do a similar analysis to the coin flips: find the \(k\) that maximizes
\[
P(\max\text{ gap} = k).
\]

### 3.4. Caveats and Other Approaches

- **True memory traces** are non-uniform and exhibit correlations. Poisson might be too simplistic if there’s strong temporal locality or strided access.  
- **Markov Models**: We can model memory references or partial working sets with Markov chains, but as in the coin problem, large state-space expansions become expensive.  
- **Machine Learning / Statistics**: Data-mining actual memory traces may give an empirical distribution of “gap lengths” or “reuse distances.”  

Still, when the event is “a particularly long gap in referencing data item \(d\),” Poisson is again often used as a first approximation for the distribution of these rare, disjoint intervals under large-scale random-like traces.

## 4. Concluding Remarks

1. **Correctness of the Provided Solution**:  
   The original solution you shared is indeed an accepted and statistically sound approximation. It is a classic application of the Poisson distribution to the problem of “finding the probability that a certain run length \(n\) is the maximum consecutive heads in a (large) number of coin tosses.”

2. **Analogy to Memory Access**:  
   By re-framing “consecutive heads” as “consecutive accesses (or consecutive non-accesses) of a given memory item,” the same type of “rare event counting” logic can apply. If each event is “seeing (or not seeing) a data item in a block of references,” the approximate independence for well-separated intervals and the rareness for large block sizes make the Poisson distribution a tempting candidate.  

3. **Exact & Detailed Approach**:  
   • We have shown how \(\lambda_n\) (and analogously \(\lambda_k\) in memory examples) is computed.  
   • We have given the formula for \(P(M \ge n)\) in the coin-tossing scenario and indicated how a similar formula can arise in memory-gap analysis with a Poisson assumption.

Thus, the solution is both correct and illustrative of how one can adapt “Poisson rare-event approximations” to similar maximum-run or maximum-gap phenomena in other domains, such as memory access patterns.
