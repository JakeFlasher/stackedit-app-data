*Algorithm for Instruction Reduction*
After completing the change point detection on the imputed IPC values, we need a fine-grained algorithm to help us filter those instructions that are supposed to contribute very little to cumulative IPC change as well as various cache performance metrics. Therefore, we design a adaptive window size calculation given an original trace file $\( T \)$, detected change points $\( \mathcal{C} \)$ and a desired instruction reduction rate $\( r \)$.
**Adaptive Window Size Calculation for Instruction Reduction**

To achieve a desired instruction reduction rate while preserving critical change points from a trace file, we employ an adaptive window size calculation using a binary search approach. The goal is to determine the optimal window size \( W \) that, when applied on each change point, results in a total number of reduced/preserved instructions close to the desired number within an acceptable tolerance.

Let us define the variables and functions used in the algorithm:

- **Variables:**
  - \( \mathcal{C} \): Set of change points.
  - \( T \): Total number of instructions.
  - \( r \): Target reduction rate (e.g., \( 0.1 \) for \( 10\% \) reduction).
  - \( \epsilon \): Tolerance (e.g., \( 0.05 \) for \( \pm5\% \) tolerance).
  - \( D \): Desired number of instructions to preserve, calculated as \( D = T (1 - r) \).
  - \( W_{\min}, W_{\max} \): Minimum and maximum window size bounds, initialized as \( W_{\min} = 0 \) and \( W_{\max} = T \).
  - \( W \): Current window size, calculated as the midpoint of \( W_{\min} \) and \( W_{\max} \).
  - \( \mathcal{R} \): List of current ranges \([s, e]\) based on \( W \) for each change point.
  - \( \mathcal{M} \): Merged list of ranges after overlapping or adjacent ranges in \( \mathcal{R} \) are combined.
  - \( P \): Total number of preserved instructions, calculated as \( P = \sum_{\langle s,e \rangle \in \mathcal{M}} (e - s + 1) \).

- **Function:**
  - \textsc{MergeOverlaps}(\( \mathcal{R} \)): A function that merges overlapping or adjacent ranges in the list \( \mathcal{R} \) and returns a list of merged ranges \( \mathcal{M} \).

**Algorithm Description:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Compute the desired number of preserved instructions:
     \[
     D = T (1 - r)
     \]
   - Set initial window size bounds:
     \[
     W_{\min} = 0, \quad W_{\max} = T
     \]

2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - While \( W_{\min} \leq W_{\max} \):
     - Calculate the current window size:
       \[
       W = \left\lfloor \dfrac{W_{\min} + W_{\max}}{2} \right\rfloor
       \]
     - Initialize an empty list \( \mathcal{R} \) for ranges.
     - **For each change point \( c \) in \( \mathcal{C} \):**
       - Compute the start and end indices of the window around \( c \):
         \[
         s = \max(0, c - \left\lfloor \dfrac{W}{2} \right\rfloor), \quad
         e = \min(T - 1, c + \left\lfloor \dfrac{W}{2} \right\rfloor - 1)
         \]
       - Add the range \([s, e]\) to \( \mathcal{R} \).
     - Sort \( \mathcal{R} \) by the start index.
     - Merge overlapping or adjacent ranges using \textsc{MergeOverlaps}:
       \[
       \mathcal{M} = \textsc{MergeOverlaps}(\mathcal{R})
       \]
     - Calculate the total number of preserved instructions:
       \[
       P = \sum_{\langle s,e \rangle \in \mathcal{M}} (e - s + 1)
       \]
     - **Convergence Check:**
       - If \( |P - D| \leq D \epsilon \), the desired window size is found. Return \( \mathcal{M} \).
       - Else if \( P < D \), preserved instructions are less than desired. Increase the window size:
         \[
         W_{\min} = W + 1
         \]
       - Else, preserved instructions are more than desired. Decrease the window size:
         \[
         W_{\max} = W - 1
         \]

3. **Finalization:**
   - If the loop concludes without finding a window size within the tolerance (e.g., due to maximum iterations), select the window size that gives the closest \( P \) to \( D \).
   - Return the final set of preserved instruction ranges \( \mathcal{M} \).

**Implementation Details:**

- **Window Size Adjustment:**
  - The binary search efficiently narrows down the window size \( W \) needed to achieve the desired instruction preservation \( D \).
  - By adjusting \( W_{\min} \) and \( W_{\max} \), the algorithm converges towards the optimal \( W \) that satisfies the condition \( |P - D| \leq D \epsilon \).

- **Handling Overlaps:**
  - The merging of ranges in \( \mathcal{R} \) ensures that overlapping or adjacent instruction ranges are combined, preventing double-counting of instructions.
  - The \textsc{MergeOverlaps} function sorts the ranges and then iteratively merges them based on overlap.

- **Preservation Calculation:**
  - The total number of preserved instructions \( P \) accounts for the actual instructions that will be kept after applying the windows around change points.
  - This value is compared against the desired number \( D \) considering the acceptable tolerance \( \epsilon \).

**Algorithm Correctness:**

- The binary search approach guarantees that the algorithm will find the optimal window size \( W \) within the specified tolerance \( \epsilon \), provided that such a \( W \) exists given the constraints.
- By considering the overlaps and accurately calculating the preserved instructions, the algorithm ensures that the reduction rate is as close as possible to the target \( r \).
- The merging of ranges prevents overestimation of preserved instructions due to overlaps, which is crucial for achieving the desired reduction rate.

**Time and Space Complexity:**

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The binary search runs in \( O(\log T) \) iterations.
  - In each iteration:
    - Range construction is \( O(|\mathcal{C}|) \).
    - Sorting ranges is \( O(|\mathcal{C}| \log |\mathcal{C}|) \).
    - Merging ranges is \( O(|\mathcal{C}|) \).
  - Overall time complexity is \( O(\log T \times |\mathcal{C}| \log |\mathcal{C}|) \).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The algorithm uses \( O(|\mathcal{C}|) \) space for storing ranges and other variables.

**Usage in Practice:**

- **Input Requirements:**
  - The total number of instructions \( T \).
  - A list of change points \( \mathcal{C} \), which are indices within the instruction sequence.
  - Desired reduction rate \( r \) and tolerance \( \epsilon \).

- **Output:**
  - A set of instruction ranges \( \mathcal{M} \) specifying which instructions to preserve.

- **Application:**
  - The algorithm is suitable for preprocessing trace files where instruction reduction is necessary, such as in processor simulations or benchmark analyses.
  - By preserving instructions around change points, the algorithm maintains critical program behaviors while reducing the overall size of the trace.
