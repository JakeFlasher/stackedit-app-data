I'm happy to provide detailed code examples to help you implement the adaptation of the Mocktails algorithm to work with ChampSim traces. I'll illustrate key components, including preprocessing ChampSim traces, implementing the Mocktails logic, and integrating the algorithm into the ChampSim pipeline.

  

Please note that while I can't provide full code implementations from existing projects or any copyrighted material, I can create original code snippets to demonstrate how you might approach each part of the implementation.

  

### 1. Preprocessing ChampSim Traces

  

**Objective:** Read ChampSim trace files and extract necessary information for the Mocktails algorithm.

  

**ChampSim Trace Format:**

  

The ChampSim trace format typically contains the following fields:

  

- `ip`: Instruction pointer (program counter).

- `is_branch`: Indicates if the instruction is a branch.

- `branch_taken`: Indicates if the branch was taken.

- `source_registers`: Array of source registers.

- `destination_registers`: Array of destination registers.

- `source_memory`: Array of source memory addresses (load addresses).

- `destination_memory`: Array of destination memory addresses (store addresses).

  

#### **Code Example: Parsing ChampSim Traces**

  

```cpp

#include <iostream>

#include <fstream>

#include <vector>

#include <string>

  

// Define constants based on ChampSim trace format

const size_t NUM_INSTR_DESTINATIONS = 2;

const size_t NUM_INSTR_SOURCES = 4;

  

// Structure representing a ChampSim instruction

struct ChampSimInstruction {

uint64_t ip;

uint8_t is_branch;

uint8_t branch_taken;

uint8_t destination_registers[NUM_INSTR_DESTINATIONS];

uint8_t source_registers[NUM_INSTR_SOURCES];

uint64_t destination_memory[NUM_INSTR_DESTINATIONS];

uint64_t source_memory[NUM_INSTR_SOURCES];

};

  

// Function to read a single instruction from the trace file

bool read_instruction(std::ifstream& trace_file, ChampSimInstruction& instr) {

// Read binary data from the file into the instruction struct

trace_file.read(reinterpret_cast<char*>(&instr), sizeof(ChampSimInstruction));

return !trace_file.eof();

}

  

// Preprocess the trace and extract memory operations

void preprocess_trace(const std::string& trace_filename,

std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>& instructions) {

std::ifstream trace_file(trace_filename, std::ios::binary);

if (!trace_file.is_open()) {

std::cerr << "Failed to open trace file: " << trace_filename << std::endl;

return;

}

  

ChampSimInstruction instr;

while (read_instruction(trace_file, instr)) {

instructions.push_back(instr);

}

  

trace_file.close();

}

```

  

#### **Explanation:**

  

- We define a `ChampSimInstruction` struct to represent each instruction in the trace.

- The `read_instruction` function reads binary data from the trace file into an instance of `ChampSimInstruction`.

- The `preprocess_trace` function reads all instructions from the trace file and stores them in a `std::vector`.

  

### 2. Implementing Mocktails Logic

  

**Objective:** Adapt the Mocktails algorithm to work with the data extracted from ChampSim traces.

  

#### **Key Components:**

  

- **Temporal Partitioning:** Divide the instruction stream into temporal phases.

- **Spatial Partitioning:** Group memory accesses into dynamic spatial partitions.

- **Statistical Modeling:** Create models for features like address strides, operation types, sizes, and timestamps.

- **Request Synthesis:** Generate synthetic memory requests based on the models.

  

#### **2.1 Temporal Partitioning**

  

```cpp

// Divide instructions into temporal phases based on instruction count

void temporal_partitioning(const std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>& instructions,

size_t phase_size,

std::vector<std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>>& phases) {

size_t total_instructions = instructions.size();

size_t num_phases = (total_instructions + phase_size - 1) / phase_size;

  

phases.resize(num_phases);

for (size_t i = 0; i < total_instructions; ++i) {

size_t phase_index = i / phase_size;

phases[phase_index].push_back(instructions[i]);

}

}

```

  

#### **2.2 Spatial Partitioning**

  

```cpp

struct AddressRange {

uint64_t start;

uint64_t end;

  

AddressRange(uint64_t addr) : start(addr), end(addr) {}

  

bool intersects(const AddressRange& other) const {

return !(end < other.start || start > other.end);

}

  

void expand(const AddressRange& other) {

if (other.start < start) start = other.start;

if (other.end > end) end = other.end;

}

};

  

// Partition memory accesses within a phase into dynamic spatial partitions

void spatial_partitioning(const std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>& phase_instructions,

std::vector<std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>>& spatial_partitions) {

std::vector<AddressRange> partitions;

  

for (const auto& instr : phase_instructions) {

// Check for memory operations

bool has_memory_op = false;

uint64_t mem_addr = 0;

  

// Assume source_memory[0] is the load address, destination_memory[0] is the store address

if (instr.source_memory[0] != 0) {

has_memory_op = true;

mem_addr = instr.source_memory[0];

} else if (instr.destination_memory[0] != 0) {

has_memory_op = true;

mem_addr = instr.destination_memory[0];

}

  

if (has_memory_op) {

bool added = false;

AddressRange current_range(mem_addr);

  

// Attempt to add to an existing partition

for (size_t i = 0; i < partitions.size(); ++i) {

if (partitions[i].intersects(current_range)) {

partitions[i].expand(current_range);

spatial_partitions[i].push_back(instr);

added = true;

break;

}

}

  

// Create a new partition if no intersection found

if (!added) {

partitions.push_back(current_range);

spatial_partitions.emplace_back();

spatial_partitions.back().push_back(instr);

}

}

}

}

```

  

#### **Explanation:**

  

- The `temporal_partitioning` function divides the instruction stream into phases based on a specified `phase_size`.

- The `spatial_partitioning` function groups memory accesses within a phase into dynamic spatial partitions.

- It uses an `AddressRange` struct to represent memory regions.

- If a memory access intersects with an existing partition, it's added to that partition.

- Otherwise, a new partition is created.

  

#### **2.3 Statistical Modeling**

  

For each spatial partition, we create statistical models for different features.

  

**Example: Modeling Address Strides**

  

```cpp

#include <unordered_map>

  

// Model for address strides within a partition

struct StrideModel {

std::unordered_map<int64_t, size_t> stride_histogram;

  

void add_stride(int64_t stride) {

stride_histogram[stride]++;

}

  

int64_t generate_stride() const {

// Implement a method to sample from the stride histogram

// For simplicity, return a random stride based on the histogram frequencies

// ... (sampling code here)

return 0; // Placeholder

}

};

  

void build_stride_model(const std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>& partition,

StrideModel& stride_model, uint64_t& start_address) {

bool first = true;

uint64_t last_address = 0;

  

for (const auto& instr : partition) {

uint64_t mem_addr = 0;

  

if (instr.source_memory[0] != 0) {

mem_addr = instr.source_memory[0];

} else if (instr.destination_memory[0] != 0) {

mem_addr = instr.destination_memory[0];

} else {

continue;

}

  

if (first) {

first = false;

start_address = mem_addr;

} else {

int64_t stride = static_cast<int64_t>(mem_addr - last_address);

stride_model.add_stride(stride);

}

  

last_address = mem_addr;

}

}

```

  

**Explanation:**

  

- We define a `StrideModel` struct that holds a histogram of observed strides.

- The `build_stride_model` function processes a partition and populates the stride histogram.

- For address generation, we can sample strides from this model and apply them to the last generated address.

  

#### **2.4 Request Synthesis**

  

```cpp

#include <queue>

#include <functional>

  

// Structure representing a memory request

struct MemoryRequest {

uint64_t timestamp;

uint64_t address;

char operation; // 'R' for read, 'W' for write

size_t size;

};

  

// Generate synthetic memory requests for a partition

void synthesize_requests(const StrideModel& stride_model,

uint64_t start_address,

size_t num_requests,

std::vector<MemoryRequest>& requests) {

uint64_t current_address = start_address;

uint64_t timestamp = 0; // Starting timestamp

  

for (size_t i = 0; i < num_requests; ++i) {

int64_t stride = stride_model.generate_stride();

current_address += stride;

  

MemoryRequest req;

req.timestamp = timestamp;

req.address = current_address;

req.operation = 'R'; // Simplification: assume all reads

req.size = 64; // Assume cache line size

  

requests.push_back(req);

  

// Increment timestamp based on a model or fixed value

timestamp += 10; // Placeholder for time delta

}

}

  

// Combine requests from all partitions into a single sequence

void combine_requests(const std::vector<std::vector<MemoryRequest>>& partition_requests,

std::vector<MemoryRequest>& combined_requests) {

// Use a priority queue to merge requests based on timestamp

auto compare = [](const MemoryRequest& lhs, const MemoryRequest& rhs) {

return lhs.timestamp > rhs.timestamp;

};

std::priority_queue<MemoryRequest, std::vector<MemoryRequest>, decltype(compare)> request_queue(compare);

  

// Insert all requests into the priority queue

for (const auto& requests : partition_requests) {

for (const auto& req : requests) {

request_queue.push(req);

}

}

  

// Extract requests in order

while (!request_queue.empty()) {

combined_requests.push_back(request_queue.top());

request_queue.pop();

}

}

```

  

**Explanation:**

  

- The `synthesize_requests` function generates synthetic memory requests for a partition based on the stride model.

- The `combine_requests` function merges requests from all partitions into a single sequence, ordered by timestamp.

  

### 3. Integration Points with ChampSim

  

**Objective:** Modify ChampSim to accept the synthesized memory requests as inputs to the simulation pipeline.

  

#### **3.1 Feeding Requests into ChampSim**

  

ChampSim typically reads instructions from a trace and processes them through its simulation components. To integrate the Mocktails-generated requests:

  

- Modify or extend the trace reader to accept synthetic requests.

- Implement a component that injects the synthesized memory requests into the ChampSim pipeline at the appropriate stage.

  

#### **Code Example: Integrating Requests**

  

```cpp

// Assume ChampSim has a function to process instructions

void process_instruction(const ChampSimInstruction& instr);

  

// Function to inject synthesized requests into ChampSim

void inject_synthesized_requests(const std::vector<MemoryRequest>& requests) {

for (const auto& req : requests) {

ChampSimInstruction instr = {};

instr.ip = 0; // Since this is synthetic, IP can be set to 0 or a placeholder

instr.is_branch = 0;

instr.branch_taken = 0;

  

if (req.operation == 'R') {

instr.source_memory[0] = req.address;

} else if (req.operation == 'W') {

instr.destination_memory[0] = req.address;

}

  

// Process the instruction through ChampSim's pipeline

process_instruction(instr);

}

}

```

  

**Explanation:**

  

- The `inject_synthesized_requests` function converts memory requests back into `ChampSimInstruction` format.

- It then feeds these instructions into ChampSim's processing function.

  

#### **3.2 Modifying ChampSim Components**

  

You may need to adjust ChampSim's components to handle synthetic instructions appropriately:

  

- **Instruction Fetch Stage:** Since we're focusing on memory requests, you might bypass instruction fetch and decode stages.

- **Cache Hierarchy:** Ensure that the caches are updated based on the synthetic memory accesses.

- **Branch Prediction:** If necessary, adjust branch predictors to account for synthetic branches or disable them.

  

### 4. Putting It All Together

  

#### **Main Function Flow**

  

```cpp

int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {

// Step 1: Preprocess ChampSim trace

std::string trace_filename = "champsim_trace.bin";

std::vector<ChampSimInstruction> instructions;

preprocess_trace(trace_filename, instructions);

  

// Step 2: Temporal Partitioning

size_t phase_size = 100000; // Define the size of temporal phases

std::vector<std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>> temporal_phases;

temporal_partitioning(instructions, phase_size, temporal_phases);

  

// Vector to hold all synthesized requests

std::vector<MemoryRequest> all_requests;

  

// Process each temporal phase

for (const auto& phase : temporal_phases) {

// Step 3: Spatial Partitioning

std::vector<std::vector<ChampSimInstruction>> spatial_partitions;

spatial_partitioning(phase, spatial_partitions);

  

// Vector to hold synthesized requests for this phase

std::vector<MemoryRequest> phase_requests;

  

// Process each spatial partition

for (const auto& partition : spatial_partitions) {

// Step 4: Build Models

StrideModel stride_model;

uint64_t start_address = 0;

build_stride_model(partition, stride_model, start_address);

  

// Step 5: Synthesize Requests

std::vector<MemoryRequest> partition_requests;

size_t num_requests = partition.size();

synthesize_requests(stride_model, start_address, num_requests, partition_requests);

  

// Collect requests from all partitions

phase_requests.insert(phase_requests.end(), partition_requests.begin(), partition_requests.end());

}

  

// Step 6: Combine Requests

std::vector<MemoryRequest> combined_requests;

combine_requests({phase_requests}, combined_requests);

  

// Collect all requests

all_requests.insert(all_requests.end(), combined_requests.begin(), combined_requests.end());

}

  

// Step 7: Inject synthesized requests into ChampSim

inject_synthesized_requests(all_requests);

  

return 0;

}

```

  

**Explanation:**

  

- **Step 1:** Preprocess the ChampSim trace to extract instructions.

- **Step 2:** Perform temporal partitioning on the instruction stream.

- **Steps 3-5:** For each temporal phase, perform spatial partitioning, build models, and synthesize requests.

- **Step 6:** Combine all synthesized requests while maintaining the correct order.

- **Step 7:** Inject the synthesized requests into ChampSim.

  

### Additional Considerations

  

- **Timing and Dependencies:** Ensure that any dependencies between memory accesses are appropriately modeled, especially if the original workload had significant data dependencies.

- **Operation Types:** Incorporate both read and write operations by analyzing the `source_memory` and `destination_memory` fields.

- **Instruction Pointer (`ip`):** If beneficial, use the `ip` to improve modeling, especially for capturing code-localized behaviors.

- **Branch Behavior:** Incorporate `is_branch` and `branch_taken` if modeling of control flow is necessary.

- **Cache Simulation:** Verify that the caches in ChampSim are correctly updated based on the synthesized memory accesses.

  

### Testing and Validation

  

- **Compare Metrics:** Run simulations with both the original and synthesized traces, comparing metrics such as cache hit rates, bandwidth utilization, and execution time.

- **Adjust Models:** If discrepancies are observed, adjust the statistical models to improve accuracy.

- **Incremental Testing:** Test each component independently before integrating, to isolate and fix issues more effectively.

  

### Conclusion

  

By following this approach, you can adapt the Mocktails algorithm to work with ChampSim traces. The code examples provided illustrate how to:

  

- Parse ChampSim traces and extract necessary data.

- Implement temporal and spatial partitioning.

- Build statistical models for memory access features.

- Synthesize memory requests based on the models.

- Integrate the synthesized requests into the ChampSim pipeline.

  

This should give you a solid foundation to implement and further refine the adaptation for your specific needs. Remember to iteratively test and validate each part of the implementation to ensure correctness and performance.
