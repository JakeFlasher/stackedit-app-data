## Definition of *Global Stable Loads*
- ***A dynamic load instance I2 of a static load instruction I is bound to fetch the same value from the same memory location as the previous dynamic instance I1 of the same static load instruction when the following two conditions are satisfied.*** 
	> 	-  Condition 1: None of the source registers of I has been written between the occurrences of I1 and I2. 
	> 	-  Condition 2: No store or store request has arrived to the memory address of I1 between the occurrences of I1 and I2. 

> Satisfying Condition 1 ensures that I2 would have the same load address as I1, and thus the address computation operation of I2 can be safely eliminated. Satisfying Condition 2 ensures that I2 would fetch the same value from the memory as I1, and thus the data fetch operation of I2 can be safely eliminated.
