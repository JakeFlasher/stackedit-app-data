### Analysis of Global-Stable Loads
>- ***Some loads repeatedly fetch the same data value from same load address across entire workload***
Both operations, address generation & data fetch, produce identical results across all dynamic instances
Prime targets for breaking data dependency without execution

> - ***Why do these loads even exist in well-optimized real-world workloads?***
Accessing global-scope variables
Accessing local variables of inline functions
Limited set of architectural registers

>- ***Can increasing architectural registers help?***
Very small change even after doubling x64 registers

>- ***Deeper characterization of global-stable loads***
Which addressing mode do they use?
How far away do they appear in a workload?

### Do they limit ILP even when using load value prediction and memory renaming? 

> ####  In an aggressive OoO processor with 6-wide issue, 3 load ports, a load value predictor (EVES [Seznec, CVP’18]), and memory renaming enabled, global-stable loads limit ILP due to resource dependence. What’s the performance headroom of mitigating the resource dependence?


### Key Improvements over Literature
#### ***A purely-microarchitectural technique, aiming to mitigates both load data dependence and load resource dependence, by safely eliminating the entire execution of a load instruction***



 > - **Focus only on loads that are likely stable**
> - **Eliminate loads early in the pipeline**
> - **Ensure correctness in today’s processors**
	> 	- Maintain correctness in presence of out-of-order load issue
		>	- Maintain coherence in multi-threaded & multi-core execution
