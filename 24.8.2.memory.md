## Two paper readings from ISCA 2024 & TACO 2024
## Constable: Improving Performance and Power Efficiency by Safely Eliminating Load Instruction Execution
### Analysis of Global-Stable Loads
>- ***Some loads repeatedly fetch the same data value from same load address across entire workload***
Both operations, address generation & data fetch, produce identical results across all dynamic instances
Prime targets for breaking data dependency without execution

> - ***Why do these loads even exist in well-optimized real-world workloads?***
Accessing global-scope variables
Accessing local variables of inline functions
Limited set of architectural registers

>- ***Can increasing architectural registers help?***
Very small change even after doubling x64 registers

>- ***Deeper characterization of global-stable loads***
Which addressing mode do they use?
How far away do they appear in a workload?

>- 

## What makes a good simulator?
- Sniper, gem5, ChampSim
- Complexity in building & coupling each components

> The dynamic instruction count is the actual number of instructions executed by the CPU for a specific program execution, whereas the static instruction count is the number of instruction the program has.
We usually use dynamic instruction count as if for example you have a loop in your program then some instructions get executed more than once. Also, in the presence of branches, some instructions may not be executed at all.
# ## Instruction Types
- ***Instruction level parallelism***
### Branch Predictors
### Event Queue (model)
### Memory Systems

## ISCA 2024 Best Paper: Constable
### On inter-occurance distance (reuse interval)
- Bimodal behavior (< 50 && > 250)
