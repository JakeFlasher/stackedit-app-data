Below is a step-by-step explanation and illustrative example of how you could reshape a “naive test-time training (TTT) model” (in your case, an RNN-based approach) into the style of PyPOTS’s “transformer-based” approach for missing data imputation (i.e., adopting the embedding strategy and training approach such as ORT + MIT, very similar to SAITS). I will be very explicit so that even if you are new to Python and PyTorch, you can follow along.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Understanding the Workflow from the PyPOTS Transformer Imputation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the scripts you’ve attached (“model_imputation.py”, “data_imputation.py”, “core_imputation.py”, “__init__imputation.py”), we see that:

• PyPOTS transforms the partially-observed multivariate time series into a representation where:
  – Real-valued inputs X are concatenated with their missing masks.
  – An embedding strategy (e.g., “SaitsEmbedding”) is performed so that the “TransformerEncoder” can accept them as input.  
  – The model reconstructs or predicts the missing entries.
  – ORT + MIT losses are used to guide training.

• The final reconstruction is given by:
  imputed_data = missing_mask * X + (1 - missing_mask) * reconstruction
  This ensures that for the observed positions, you keep the original data points, and for the missing ones, you take the model’s predictions.

• The code structure typically:
  – A dataset class (e.g., “DatasetForTransformer”) is used to load data (X / X_ori / missing_mask / indicating_mask).
  – A model class (“Transformer”) wraps around a core module (“_Transformer”), which in turn uses “TransformerEncoder.”
  – Loss functions (SaitsLoss) combine ORT & MIT losses.

To refactor your TTT model (naive PyTorch script with an RNN inside) into a PyPOTS-like imputation style, you will similarly:
1) Replace the naive-RNN-based architecture with the TTT architecture (or adapt the TTT update rules) but in such a way that you accept both (X, missing_mask) as input to an embedding, and 2) produce reconstruction that is combined with the ground truth to fill the missing positions.  
2) Use the ORT + MIT loss or a similar combined loss objective that suits TTT, ensuring that your TTT can handle partial sequences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Key Building Blocks in PyPOTS and Their Analogs in a TTT-based Model
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a simplified mapping:

(1) The “Embedding” Module in PyPOTS:
  In the “_Transformer” class, you’ll notice:
  
      self.saits_embedding = SaitsEmbedding(
          n_features * 2,
          d_model,
          with_pos=True,
          n_max_steps=n_steps,
          dropout=dropout
      )
  
  This does two main tasks:
  • Concatenates feature values and missing_mask along the channel dimension.  
  • Adds positional encoding so the model sees each time step’s position in the sequence.  
  In TTT, you may or may not need positional encodings (if you treat it as a purely recurrent approach). However, to unify with the PyPOTS style, you should embed both the data and the missingness indicator.

(2) The “Encoder” (Transformer or a custom RNN/TTT) in PyPOTS:
  In PyPOTS’s “_Transformer” code, you see:
  
      enc_output, _ = self.encoder(input_X)
  
  In your TTT-based approach, the “TTT layer” normally wants to update parameters on the fly, depending on your mini-batch, etc. If you are going to keep the “test-time training” flavor but also want to keep the same input signature as PyPOTS, you need to:
  • Accept input_X, which is shape [batch_size, sequence_length, embed_dim].  
  • Possibly apply your TTT updates when rolling over each time step.  
  • Return an output of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, d_model].

(3) The “Output Projection” + Imputation in PyPOTS:
  After the encoder (be it TTT-layers, or standard transfomer, or an RNN with TTT), we do:
  
      reconstruction = self.output_projection(enc_output)
      imputed_data = missing_mask * X + (1 - missing_mask) * reconstruction
  
  This ensures the original data for observed positions and predicted data for missing positions.  
  For TTT, you’d do the same in the forward pass.

(4) The “Loss Functions” (SAITSLoss with ORT + MIT) in PyPOTS:
  In PyPOTS, the training step returns a dictionary containing "loss", in addition to "ORT_loss" and "MIT_loss". In your TTT case, you can replicate that with your TTT update rules:
  
  – ORT (Observation Reconstruction Term) basically imposes that the final reconstruction matches the ground-truth observed entries.  
  – MIT (Mask-IndicatingTerm, or MSE on indicated entries in SAITS) ensures that the model also reconstructs from the perspective of the missing positions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Proposed Refactored Script Outline (Pseudo-Code)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below, I’ll show a hypothetical PyTorch module that we can call TTTImputer, which follows the PyPOTS Transformer template but uses TTT ideas. Comments are verbose and will help you see parallels.

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Explanation of Key Steps in ttt_imputer.py:

• self.saits_embedding(…) does “X concat missing_mask” internally.  
• We do a forward pass through some TTT-based recurrent block. If you want to replicate the “TTT forward” from your “ttt.py” script, you can do so here. The key is that after you embed your data, you want to iterate through the time dimension, possibly updating your TTT parameters.  
• Then you project the hidden state back to “n_features.”  
• In training mode, you compute your combined losses.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Where the TTT Core Logic Plugs In
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In your original TTT code (from “ttt.py”), you likely have a “forward” method that does:

1) Accept hidden_states, do the TTT-layers’ update.  
2) Possibly do mini-batch-based gradient updates (the TTT adaptation).  
3) Return updated hidden states.

If you want to keep that logic, you might:

• Replace the “self.ttt_rnn = nn.GRU(...)” with your custom TTT block.  
• Instead of calling “rnn_output, _ = self.ttt_rnn(embed_x),” call something like “rnn_output = self.my_ttt_block(embed_x).”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. A Note on Mini-Batch & Online TTT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“Test-time training” often implies that at test time, you adapt the model parameters to each test instance. PyPOTS is normally a “training-time” approach with an “inference-only” pass. If you want to keep TTT fully, you’d want to do something like:

• For each test sample x in test loader, you do a few gradient updates on the TTT model’s parameters, using the partial data from x. Then you produce a final reconstruction.  

This is mostly a matter of how you configure your “predict(...)” or “impute(...)” routines in the PyPOTS-likes. But code-structure wise, you can slot that in with custom “prepare_inputs_for_generation,” or a simple “adapt(model, X)” function at inference time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Detailed Math for ORT + MIT (as done in SAITS but applicable to TTT)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The total loss = loss = ORT_weight × ORT_loss + MIT_weight × MIT_loss

If your reconstruction is R and the ground truth X_ori, you have a missing_mask and an indicating_mask. A typical definition from the SAITS paper is:

• ORT_loss = MSE over the observed positions:  
  ORT_loss = MSE(R ⊙ M, X_ori ⊙ M)  
  i.e. only measure the MSE where M=1 means “observed.”  

• MIT_loss = MSE over the “to-be-imputed positions” indicated in the “indicating_mask.”  
  MIT_loss = MSE(R ⊙ IndMask, X_ori ⊙ IndMask).  

Hence, the forward pass in your code:  
  loss, ORT_loss, MIT_loss = self.saits_loss_func(reconstruction, X_ori, missing_mask, indicating_mask)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
7. Example Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a mini snippet of how you’d train this TTTImputer in the same manner PyPOTS trains:

──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Suppose we have a dataset loader that yields
#   data:  (indices, X, missing_mask, X_ori, indicating_mask)
model = TTTImputer(n_steps=..., n_features=..., d_model=..., hidden_size=..., num_layers=...)
model.train()

optimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-3)

for epoch in range(max_epochs):
    for i, data in enumerate(train_loader):
        # data is [indices, X, missing_mask, X_ori, indicating_mask]
        # assemble into inputs dictionary
        inputs = {
            "X": data[1],
            "missing_mask": data[2],
            "X_ori": data[3],
            "indicating_mask": data[4],
        }
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        results = model(inputs, training=True)  # forward
        loss_value = results["loss"]
        loss_value.backward()
        optimizer.step()

    # maybe do validation here, early stopping, etc.
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

This is precisely how “Transformer” in PyPOTS is trained inside “model_imputation.py,” only that we replaced the Transformer-based “_Transformer” with our TTTImputer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
8. Wrap-Up
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You’ve just seen how to:

1. Create a module that handles partial data (X plus mask) in the same structural manner as PyPOTS.  
2. Embed the data with “SaitsEmbedding” or a similar embedding approach (positional + concatenation).  
3. Pass it to your TTT logic (replacing the standard RNN, or the “TransformerEncoder,” or whichever).  
4. Project back to data dimension and fill missing spots.  
5. Compute ORT+MIT or a combined loss.  

This is essentially how you transform your naive TTT (RNN-based) approach into a PyPOTS-like imputation approach. If at test time you want to do real “test-time training” (adapt the model with each test sample), that can be done by adding a small adaptation loop inside the predict/impute functions before final inference—just be mindful of PyTorch’s context, re-initializing optimizers, etc.

I hope this clarifies how to refactor your TTT code into the PyPOTS style for missing data imputation. Don’t hesitate to add more specifics if you have unique details in your TTT model (like specialized parameter updates), but the broad steps are as above. Good luck!
