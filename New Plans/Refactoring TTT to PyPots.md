Below is a step-by-step guide (with detailed explanations and code) demonstrating how one might refactor or reshape a test-time training (TTT) model (originally a naïve RNN approach) into a structure aligned with how PyPOTS handles the “transformer” imputation, incorporating the same key ideas:  
1) Concatenate original time series values and missing masks in the embedding (as SAITS does).  
2) Use the same training approach with ORT and MIT losses (as in SAITS).  
3) Produce imputed outputs that fill unknown entries with the model’s predictions but leave known entries intact.  

Everything here is spelled out in detail so you can see how to replicate the example of PyPOTS’s “Transformer” approach for another model such as a test-time training RNN. Even if you ultimately replace the RNN with a different backbone (e.g. a GRU, LSTM, or another family of modules), the framework can remain the same.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. UNDERSTAND THE PYPOPTS STRUCTURE FOR IMPUTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• In PyPOTS’s “transformer” approach (files like model_imputation.py, core_imputatiuon.py), the key points are:  
  – The forward pass needs four main items in training:  
    1) X (partially observed data)  
    2) missing_mask (1 if observed, 0 if missing)  
    3) X_ori (the ground-truth data, used for the ORT and MIT losses)  
    4) indicating_mask (a mask telling which values are artificially masked for training, i.e. which are used for MIT Loss)  

  – X and missing_mask get sent into an embedding that concatenates them (like SAITS does).  
  – The embedding output is processed by one or more layers of the model’s main backbone (in the Transformer example, it’s a multi-head self-attention block).  
  – The final output is linearly projected back to the original data dimension.  
  – For all entries that are observed, the output is overwritten by the original observed values (so the model only tries to predict missing entries).  
  – ORT and MIT losses are computed in the same way as SAITS does.  

Therefore, to replicate “test-time training RNN” inside the same pipeline, we must:  
  – Write a wrapper PyTorch module (similar to _Transformer) that:  
    1) Embeds the inputs.  
    2) Passes the embedded vector through an RNN.  
    3) Projects hidden states back to the original data dimension.  
    4) Masks out the observed entries (the ones that are not missing).  
    5) Returns a dictionary containing the imputed_data and the losses if in training.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. DETAILED MATH / LOGIC FOR “SAITS-LIKE” EMBEDDING + ORT+MIT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a summary of the key math:  

• Let X ∈ ℝ^(B×T×F) be the (batch_size × time_steps × features) time-series.  
• Let M ∈ {0,1}^(B×T×F) be the missing_mask with 1 for observed entries, 0 for missing.  
• In SAITS or PyPOTS, we construct an “augmented” input by concatenating X and M along the feature dimension:  

  (1)  X' = Concat(X, M)   // shape is (B, T, 2F)  

• Then we pass X' through an “embedding” layer to transform from 2F → d_model, possibly adding positional embeddings:  

  (2)  E = SAITSEmbedding(X') ∈ ℝ^(B×T×d_model)  

• The backbone (Transformer, or RNN if we’re adopting TTT RNN) transforms E → H:  

  (3)  H = RNN(E)  // shape (B, T, d_model)  

  or in Transformer version: H = SelfAttention(E)  

• Then we linearly project H from d_model back to F:  

  (4)  R = W * H + b  // shape (B, T, F)  

  where W ∈ ℝ^(F×d_model), b ∈ ℝ^(F).  

• We create the final “imputed_data” by combining R with the observed part of X:  

  (5)  imputed_data = M ⊙ X + (1 - M) ⊙ R  

  (where ⊙ is elementwise multiplication).  

• Meanwhile, in training, an ORT+MIT loss is computed similarly to SAITS:  
  – ORT = ||(R - X_ori) ⊙ (1 - M_obs)||²   (squared error for the originally missing part)  
  – MIT = ||(R - X_ori) ⊙ IndicatingMask||² (squared error for artificially masked entries)  
  – total_loss = ORT_weight * ORT + MIT_weight * MIT  

  where:  
    – X_ori is the original ground truth with no artificial missingness.  
    – M_obs is the original missing mask.  
    – IndicatingMask is the artificial missing mask telling which entries are deliberately masked for training.  

If you’re new to PyTorch, the code below shows step by step how to implement these.

3. EXAMPLE CODE: A REFASHIONED NAÏVE “TTT RNN” FOR IMPUTATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an illustrative code snippet that tries to look structurally similar to the PyPOTS “transformer” code, but uses an RNN backbone for test-time training. We’ll use a simple GRU as an example. You can replace GRU with LSTM, plain RNN, or any other custom cell.

Note: The code snippet is long, but each part is annotated. It recommends how your “new TTT RNN” model might be placed in a file analogous to core_imputatiuon.py, with a class name like _TTT_RNN or something, then used exactly as the PyPOTS Transformer is used in model_imputation.py.

Explanation of key points in the code:

• SaitsEmbedding  
  – This concatenates (X, missing_mask) along the last dimension to form [B, T, 2F].  
  – Then goes through a Linear(d_model).  
  – Optionally adds positional encoding (as the Transformer does in PyPOTS).  

• _TTT_RNN class  
  – initialization:  
    1) We store the parameters (n_steps, n_features, etc.).  
    2) We create SaitsEmbedding as above.  
    3) We create the RNN itself (in this example, a GRU). You can swap it for LSTM, etc.  
    4) We create a final linear projection to get shape (B, T, F).  
    5) We create a SaitsLoss instance to handle ORT and MIT.  

  – forward(...)  
    1) We embed X, missing_mask → shape (B, T, d_model).  
    2) We pass that through the GRU to get shape (B, T, hidden_size).  
    3) We linearly project to shape (B, T, F), calling that reconstruction.  
    4) We produce imputed_data by combining the model’s reconstruction for the missing parts with the original data for the observed parts.  
    5) If training, compute the ORT+MIT losses and store them in results.  

You can further wrap _TTT_RNN in a higher-level class (like TTTForImputation or TTTModel) just like TTTForCausalLM or TTTModel in TTT’s code or TTTModel in PyPOTS. That class would handle loading data, preparing batches, and so forth—mirroring what model_imputation.py does with the Transformer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. PUTTING IT ALL TOGETHER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With that single “_TTT_RNN” module in place, you can do what PyPOTS does with “model = _Transformer(...).” For example:

1) In a separate file “model_test_time_training.py,” do something like:

```python
import torch
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader
from .core_test_time_rnn import _TTT_RNN
from ...base import BaseNNImputer  # or similar from PyPOTS

class TTT_RNN_Imputer(BaseNNImputer):
    def __init__(self, 
                 n_steps, 
                 n_features,
                 n_layers,
                 d_model,
                 hidden_size,
                 dropout=0.0,
                 ORT_weight=1.0,
                 MIT_weight=1.0,
                 # plus any other hyperparams like epochs, batch_size, etc.
                 ):
        super().__init__(
            # pass higher-level hyperparams to BaseNNImputer
        )
        self.model = _TTT_RNN(
            n_steps=n_steps,
            n_features=n_features,
            n_layers=n_layers,
            d_model=d_model,
            hidden_size=hidden_size,
            dropout=dropout,
            ORT_weight=ORT_weight,
            MIT_weight=MIT_weight,
        )
        # set up self.optimizer, etc.

    def fit(self, train_set, val_set=None, file_type="hdf5"):
        # just like the Transformer’s fit(...) function in model_imputation.py
        # Step 1: wrap data in a DataLoader
        # Step 2: training loop with self.model
        pass

    def predict(self, test_set, file_type="hdf5"):
        # again, just like Transformer’s predict(...) in model_imputation.py
        # Step 1: wrap test data in DataLoader
        # Step 2: self.model.eval(); do forward; collect imputation
        pass
```

2) Now you have a new imputer class called TTT_RNN_Imputer that uses the same approach as the PyPOTS “Transformer” for partially observed time series but with a TTT-based RNN backbone. This means:  
   – You can pass your dataset (with X, missing_mask, X_ori, etc.) to it.  
   – You can train it with ORT+MIT.  
   – You can generate imputations consistently with the pipeline PyPOTS uses.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. EXTENDING IT FURTHER: TEST-TIME TRAINING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• The notion of “test-time training” (TTT) often means: at inference time, you might finetune or adapt the model on each test sample (or small batch) by using some self-supervised objective or partial known data to better adapt quickly.  
• By embedding this approach into this PyPOTS-like pipeline, you’d do something along the lines of:  
  – For each new sample x_test (with partial observations), you run a short number of gradient steps to refine the model’s parameters (or a subset of them) with the reconstruction objective on whichever parts are “known,” before generating an imputation.  

This can be integrated within the “predict(...)” method. For example, you could do something like:

1) Switch the model from eval mode → train mode to allow gradients.  
2) For each batch in the test set:  
   – For a fixed small number of steps, do forward + backward with your TTT objective (like MSE on the known part) on that batch alone.  
   – Then produce the final imputed_data.  

This ensures your model adapts to each test sample’s distribution. Of course, TTT can be tricky and you have to decide exactly which parameters to adapt, how many steps to do, etc. But the pipeline remains the same: the data shape, the embedding, the final reconstruction, and the missing/observed masks.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• The key to “refactoring your test-time training model to align with the PyPOTS Transformer approach” is simply to replicate the “embedding + backbone + linear projection + reconstruction + ORT+MIT loss” pipeline.  
• The code snippet provided gives a direct example of building an RNN-based version of the “_Transformer” module in PyPOTS.  
• Then you can place it inside a “model_xxx.py” class that inherits from the same base class (BaseNNImputer) used by PyPOTS Transformers, making the usage/fit/predict flow consistent with other PyPOTS imputation methods.  
• If you want strict test-time training, integrate a small training loop in the predict(...) method to refine the model’s parameters using partial supervision.  

By following these steps, you’ll have a TTT-based RNN imputation model that fits seamlessly into the same pipeline as the “Transformer” in PyPOTS. And importantly, you won’t be skipping any of the details crucial for handling partially-observed time series (embedding, masking, ORT+MIT losses, patching outputs to keep original observed data).  

Hopefully this detailed breakdown clarifies exactly how to implement it in Python and PyTorch, step by step!


Below is an illustrative walkthrough of how you can refactor (or reshape) a naïve test-time training (TTT) model (originally an RNN approach) into a style similar to how PyPOTS deals with the “Transformer” for partial observations and imputation. We will incorporate the ideas of:  
• Embedding strategy (concatenate the input with its missing mask),  
• ORT + MIT loss (as in SAITS),  
• PyTorch’s forward / training loop that aligns with the typical PyPOTS “imputer” style.

Since you mentioned you’re extremely new to Python and PyTorch, the explanation below is detailed. I’ll first summarize the main concepts, then provide a step-by-step refactor with code.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) KEY IDEAS BEHIND PYPOUTS-STYLE IMPUTATION
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.1) Embedding Strategy (X & Missing Mask):
In many PyPOTS imputation models, you’ll see something like the following in their forward pass:  
  • They have an input X of shape [batch_size, sequence_length, n_features].  
  • They also have a missing_mask of the same shape, which indicates (with 0/1) where X is missing vs. observed.  

The model first concatenates X and missing_mask along the feature dimension, forming shape [batch_size, sequence_length, 2 * n_features]. That concatenated data is then projected (via a linear layer) into d_model. This results in a “learned embedding” that is fed into the backbone (RNN, Transformer, etc.).

1.2) ORT + MIT Loss:
• ORT refers to Original Reconstruction Task. It is basically a reconstruction loss that measures how well the model reconstructs the originally observed values.  
• MIT refers to Masked Imputation Task. It is a separate reconstruction loss that measures how well the model reconstructs the part of the data that was artificially masked for training.  

Hence, total_loss = ORT_weight * ORT_loss + MIT_weight * MIT_loss

Where each sub-loss might be an MAE, MSE, CrossEntropy, or whichever measure you prefer for continuous/time-series data. For PyPOTS, an MAE-like function is often used, e.g. SaitsLoss.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2) HOW TO REFASHION A NAÏVE RNN (TEST-TIME TRAINING)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let’s assume you have a basic recurrent model that at every time step t does:
    
    h_t = RNNCell(x_t, h_{t-1})
    y_t = some_output_layer(h_t)

But we want to integrate this with the same framework as PyPOTS. Specifically:

• We define an “embedding” module that:  
  → Takes in [X, missing_mask] (concatenated)  
  → Applies a linear layer to get a d_hidden dimensional feature.  
  → (Optionally) adds positional encoding if you want to parallel the Transformer style.  
  → (Optionally) applies dropout.  

• We define a “backbone” module that in your case is an RNN. It could be LSTM, GRU, or vanilla RNNCell rolled in a loop.  

• We define an “output projection” module that maps from the RNN hidden dimension back to Y (the data dimension).  

• We define a “loss function” that calculates ORT and MIT. Then total loss = ORT + MIT.

Below is a minimal (and purely illustrative) PyTorch module that follows the same pattern as the Transformer code in PyPOTS. It uses:  
• SaitsEmbedding-like approach for input.  
• RNN as the “encoder.”  
• A final linear for output.  
• A SaitsLoss-like function for ORT + MIT.

Explanation of the Logic in MyTTTRNN
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

• self.embedding(...) merges X and mask, feeds them through a linear layer.  
• self.rnn(...) is a standard PyTorch RNN (it could be LSTM, plain RNN, or GRU). We do not do anything fancy with hidden states (like skip connections or layer norms).  
• reconstruction = self.output_projection(rnn_output). This is an attempt to map the hidden states back to the raw data dimension.  
• imputed_data = missing_mask * X + (1 - missing_mask) * reconstruction. So if label in missing_mask is 1, that means the value is observed in X, so we keep it. If it’s 0, we fill it with the model’s reconstruction.  
• The total TTT loss = ORT + MIT.

4) A POSSIBLE TRAINING LOOP
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Below is a minimal training loop using MyTTTRNN. Notice that we follow the PyPOTS pattern of passing a dictionary of inputs to the forward function, then reading out “results[‘loss’]” for backprop:

def train_one_epoch(model, dataloader, optimizer):
    model.train()
    running_loss = 0.0
    for batch_idx, data in enumerate(dataloader):
        # data might be something like:
        # [indices, X, missing_mask, X_ori, indicating_mask]
        # which you then put on device, etc.
        idx, X, missing_mask, X_ori, indicating_mask = data
        inputs = {
            "X": X,
            "missing_mask": missing_mask,
            "X_ori": X_ori,
            "indicating_mask": indicating_mask,
        }
        optimizer.zero_grad()
        results = model(inputs, training=True)
        loss = results["loss"]
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
        running_loss += loss.item()
    return running_loss / len(dataloader)

def validate(model, dataloader):
    model.eval()
    running_loss = 0.0
    with torch.no_grad():
        for data in dataloader:
            idx, X, missing_mask, X_ori, indicating_mask = data
            inputs = {
                "X": X,
                "missing_mask": missing_mask,
                "X_ori": X_ori,
                "indicating_mask": indicating_mask,
            }
            results = model(inputs, training=True)  
            # For validation, we also have ground-truth X and indicating_mask, so we can compute a loss.
            # Sometimes you might do "training=False" and skip the extra loss. It's up to you.
            loss = results["loss"]
            running_loss += loss.item()
    return running_loss / len(dataloader)

5) SUMMARY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This rough example shows how a naïve test-time training approach with an RNN can be structured similarly to PyPOTS’s “Transformer” approach by combining:

• (X, MissingMask) → Embedding  
• RNN backbone (instead of TransformerEncoder)  
• Output projection back to original dimension  
• Imputation = mix of original observed data and the reconstructed predictions  
• A specially-designed SAITS-like loss function (ORT + MIT)  

By carefully following this design, you can adapt almost any architecture (CNN, RNN, or advanced attention-based methods) to handle partial time series and to produce an imputation consistent with PyPOTS’s pipeline.

That’s the essence of refactoring your TTT RNN model into a PyPOTS-like style. You get clear separation of steps, straightforward training, and a consistent data-flow for partial sequences.

Hope this helps you rewrite your own code for test-time training in a style akin to the PyPOTS transformer-based imputation! If anything is unclear or you want to see more details, feel free to ask.
