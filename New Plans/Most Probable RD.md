**Formulating the Statistical Problem: “Most Probable Reuse Distance”**  

Below is a step-by-step formulation of how one might model the reuse distance (or reuse interval) in a very large sequence of memory accesses, identify the most probable reuse distance under a simple scenario, and then gain insights on how to generalize or determine a threshold (boundary) between “small” and “large” distances.

## 1. Simplest Model Assumptions

1. We have a memory system with an array of size \(N\).  
2. We generate a long sequence of memory accesses of length \(M\) (think \(M \gg N\)).  
3. Each access is (initially) assumed to be uniformly random over the \(N\) data elements, with probability \(\frac{1}{N}\) of accessing any particular element on that access.  
4. Consecutive accesses are assumed independent of each other.

These assumptions are quite strong/simplistic, but they help illustrate the core ideas before we adjust for real-life complexities (e.g., temporal locality, strided access, skewed distributions, correlations, etc.).

### 1.1. Defining Reuse Distance

• **Reuse Distance / Reuse Interval**: For a given data element \(d\), if it is accessed at time (or step) \(t\), its next access time to the same element \(d\) is \(t + X\). The reuse distance \(X\) is the number of *intervening* accesses between these two consecutive accesses of \(d\).  

  – In some literature, “reuse distance” is the number of *distinct* addresses accessed in between;  
  – In other literature, “reuse interval” is the total number of *all* memory accesses (not necessarily distinct) between consecutive accesses to the same datum.  

Here, let’s adopt the simpler notion of a reuse interval = “the number of memory accesses that happen between time \(t\) and the next time \(d\) is accessed.”  

---

## 2. Deriving the Distribution in the Simplest Case

Let’s focus on a specific data element \(d\). We assume each of the \(M\) accesses picks a data element independently and uniformly at random from \(\{1,2,\dots,N\}\).

### 2.1. Geometric-like Behavior

• **Probability of Accessing \(d\)**: Each individual access is to \(d\) with probability \(p = 1/N\).  

• **Time Until Next Access**: If we are “starting the clock” right after we have accessed \(d\), then for each subsequent memory reference, the probability of “accessing \(d\) again” is \(p = 1/N\). The probability of “not accessing \(d\)” is \(1-p = 1 - 1/N\).  

Under these independence assumptions, the number of *accesses until the next time we see \(d\)* follows a **Geometric**-type distribution. There are slight variations in the exact parameterization (some define the geometric random variable as “number of failures before the first success,” some as “number of trials up to and including the first success”), but the essence is the same:

\[
P(X = k) \;=\; (1-p)^{k}\,p, 
\quad \text{where }p=\frac{1}{N}.
\]

Here \(k\) corresponds to the number of intervals (or accesses) between consecutive hits to \(d\).  In some texts, \(k\) is “the count *before* the success,” meaning if \(k=0\), the next access is \(d\) immediately. If you prefer the version “the number of references strictly in between,” then the PMF might shift by 1. But the shape of the distribution is essentially the same.

### 2.2. Most Likely (Mode) of the Reuse Distance

For a geometric distribution with parameter \(p = 1/N\):
- The **mode** (most likely value) is 0 (or 1), depending on your definition. In other words, the single most probable gap length is typically the smallest possible gap.  

This might sound counter-intuitive because we are often more *interested* in large reuse distances (they cause more cache misses). But from a purely mathematical standpoint, the geometric distribution is heavily skewed: short intervals happen more frequently, while extremely large intervals occur more rarely.  

Hence, in the simplest i.i.d. model:
- The “most probable” reuse distance is the minimal distance (0 or 1 in different parameterizations).  
- The “long” reuse distances of interest are rare, but they *do* happen—and can have a significant impact on performance (causing cache misses or re-fetches).

---

## 3. Determining a “Boundary” Between Small and Large Reuse Distances

Because the typical (“most likely”) value remains very small and isn’t necessarily the best representation of *where performance changes*, we often define a **threshold** \(T\) and classify:  
- **“Small Reuse Distance” if** \(X \le T\),  
- **“Large Reuse Distance” if** \(X > T\).  

### 3.1. Choosing the Threshold \(T\)

1. **Percentile/Quantile Criterion**: One typical approach is to pick \(T\) so that \(P(X \le T) = \alpha\) for some chosen percentile \(\alpha\) (e.g., 0.90 or 0.95). Then you say “the top 5–10% of reuse distances are considered ‘large.’”  

2. **Cost-Based Criterion**: Another approach is to define “large” as any reuse distance that likely leads to a cache miss. If the cache can hold the data item for roughly \(\tau\) references, you choose \(T\approx \tau\). Any reuse distance shorter than \(\tau\) is likely a cache hit (small distance), while any reuse distance longer than \(\tau\) is likely a cache miss (large distance).

#### 3.1.1. Example: Geometric Distribution’s Tail

If \(X\sim\text{Geom}(p=1/N)\), then  
\[
P(X > T) = (1 - p)^T = \Bigl(1-\tfrac1N\Bigr)^{T}.
\]
We can set \(\Bigl(1-\tfrac1N\Bigr)^{T} = \beta\), for example, if we want the fraction of “large” reuse distances to be \(\beta\). Solve for \(T\):
\[
T = \frac{\ln \beta}{\ln (1 - 1/N)}.
\]
If \(\beta=0.1\), for instance, we get a 90th percentile threshold on the distribution.

## 4. Generalizing Beyond the Simplest Model

### 4.1. Non-Uniform Access Distributions  
In reality, access patterns are seldom uniform. Some data elements are “hot” (accessed more frequently), others are rarely touched. If each element \(d\) has its own probability \(p_d\), you might model each data access as picking element \(d\) with probability \(p_d\). The reuse distance distribution for each element then becomes geometric-like with parameter \(p_d\). The threshold approach remains, but now each \(d\) has a different distribution and potentially a different notion of “large.”

### 4.2. Temporal Locality and Correlations  
Real traces exhibit correlation (e.g., if we just accessed an array in a stride pattern, the next element might be more likely to be a neighbor, etc.). The “i.i.d. uniform” assumption breaks down.  
- One might use **Markov models** or more complex block-based models to capture temporal locality.  
- Reuse distances can then be computed from these models or simply collected empirically from real runs and analyzed statistically.

### 4.3. Summaries for Cache Miss Estimation  
Often, we do not need the entire distribution of reuse distances—only certain summary statistics: • the fraction of distances likely to exceed the cache’s capacity threshold; • an approximate average miss ratio.  
In these cases, one still might fit or approximate the empirical reuse-distance histogram with a known family of distributions (geometric, exponential, or even heavier-tailed distributions) and choose a threshold accordingly.

## 5. Putting It All Together

1. **Formulate the Problem**:  
   “Given a sequence of \(M\) memory accesses over \(N\) data items, find the probability distribution of the reuse distance (the gap between consecutive accesses of the same data item). Then identify the single distance \(k\) that is most probable (the mode), and find a threshold \(T\) that splits ‘small vs. large’ distances with respect to performance or percentile criteria.”

2. **Simplest Scenario (i.i.d. Uniform)**:  
   • Each item is chosen with probability \(1/N\).  
   • Reuse distances for a specific item follow a geometric distribution with parameter \(1/N\).  
   • The mode is typically 0 (or 1).  
   • To find a “large” threshold, either pick a percentile or a cache-based cutoff.

3. **Generalization for Real Traces**:  
   • Build a more nuanced model of the access distribution (Markov or empirical).  
   • Compute or estimate the reuse distance distribution.  
   • Choose your threshold based on practical performance considerations—e.g., if “any reuse distance above \(\tau\)” leads to eviction and hence a miss, set \(T=\tau\).

---

## 6. Why This Matters (Performance Insight)

• **Cache Hits**: If the reuse distance is small (e.g., below the cache capacity threshold or time threshold), the data is likely still in cache, resulting in a relatively cheap access. This is frequent but not so costly.  
• **Cache Misses**: Large reuse distances (especially ones beyond the capability of the cache to hold data) cause re-fetch from memory, often the critical culprit for performance slowdown.  

Hence, from a system or GPU-kernel standpoint, the “rare but large” reuse intervals are typically the main cause of performance hits (and thus are the primary objects of study).

---

# Final Highlights

1. **The Most Probable Reuse Distance** in a simplistic i.i.d. scenario is (perhaps surprisingly) the *smallest* distance (0 or 1).  
2. However, the *largest distances*—while rare—are typically far more interesting for system performance and *define* whether we get a miss or a re-fetch event.  
3. To define a “boundary” between small and large reuse distances, either:  
   - Use a distribution-based percentile, or  
   - Use a cache model parameter (e.g., “distance > \tau means eviction”).  

In summary, the simplest scenario provides immediate theoretical insight (a geometric-like distribution, mode is near 0). Real workloads deviate but often can be approximated in a similar “rare event” framework or measured empirically, and we still rely on the same principle: pick a threshold that captures the “long tail” events likely to affect caching significantly.
